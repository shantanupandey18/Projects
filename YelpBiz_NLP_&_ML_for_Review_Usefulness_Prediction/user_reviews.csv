FTcRb7TUjE-K6spSjs-0TA,CMYCfKoEu0WF9_43zRgr8g,5Ce3lZksYVkCbrihqylVHQ,5.0,2,We love this little restaurant! It's not as overrated  and loud compared to other places in Tucson. Sushi is awesome and for the right price.
oyxS126nYDZOL0qwPa8how,CMYCfKoEu0WF9_43zRgr8g,CA5BOxKRDPGJgdUQ8OUOpw,5.0,1,"We came here for dinner this evening and was absolutely delicious! Truly I was blown away. I ordered a fish special at market price and couldn't believe how yummy it was. Can't recall the name of the fish but it was in the grouper family. It tasted very identical to crab meat.   I had my one year old daughter with and couldn't get her to eat anything, but she loved my fish! Service was friendly. Love it here, but it is pricey! $100+ for two people, however every penny was well spent."
KbFlOy2PN2dXBjdk4mpz8g,CMYCfKoEu0WF9_43zRgr8g,1MAQQhmUNU0uzHw3KhPczg,1.0,4,"Just a heads up the owner, Roya, will not give refunds or respond to clients. I paid $500+ to reserve hair and makeup for my bridal party in September.   I was not informed that the business was closed and haven't received any responses regarding to getting a refund. Roya is a total scammer and a disgrace to the beauty industry.  I have a contract and proof regarding their refund policy for weddings, it says 50% of the total was due and a refund is eligible if given 14 days notice. Here I am giving almost 4 months notice. What a huge disappointment. Hopefully she isn't allowed to start a new business just to steal people's money."
mslt0F7LpdBMQmKGkn-bAA,CMYCfKoEu0WF9_43zRgr8g,QXB4E78FXn3eotalXUG0bQ,1.0,9,"Came in to get my ends cleaned up, FIVE TO SIX inches of my hair was hacked off when I specified no more than two. This place is a girls ultimate nightmare if you want to somewhat keep your length. I tried to be reasonable and give it a few days to get used to it, however NOBODY should ever feel this way after getting their hair done. If you're looking for a professional ladies hair cut, go elsewhere. I'm now investing out of pocket to get extensions. By far the worst hair cut I've ever had in my life."
5SGsoqgx8CBbw6bcrsi0NQ,CMYCfKoEu0WF9_43zRgr8g,M983OPfVRnwvG7zEOzykCA,4.0,0,love the atmosphere!!! The patio is the best area to sit and relax with a significant other. They've got outdoor stone fireplaces set up and comfortable (modern) furniture to dine/drink on. I'm only giving this place four stars is because their sushi is not very good... they strictly use imitation crab or no meat at all.
tBfTKrhnuTB4pmjyXVHGjw,CMYCfKoEu0WF9_43zRgr8g,J-Go00lYW4f4a3lLLtoh_A,5.0,0,Breakfast is bomb!!! We usually come in an hour before closing since there's a long wait in the a.m.!
Rmv9zoXR5ULycbak7UTM2w,aMP9YyQbzcxXTGkWEy1kvg,5Ce3lZksYVkCbrihqylVHQ,5.0,0,There is a sushi bar that relocated here on the east side that's pretty good. I've eaten there a couple of times and so far like it. There no more expensive then other sushi bars so you'll know about what to expect when u get there. If u set at bar you'll get soup when u order sushi that's no charge kinda helps fill u up. (And good for you) anyway I'll recommend this sushi .
,aMP9YyQbzcxXTGkWEy1kvg,LDkD5R5N7CG9yCD0YSLMZA,4.0,0,We enjoyed the shrimp fu young. Have had it a couple of times and it's been great every time. Not sure about the other items on menu but will try more of the food over time.
DLu-Uw9zf95a34wntChWxA,aMP9YyQbzcxXTGkWEy1kvg,,1.0,2,The service friendly however the food really missed the mark ( we will not be going back)
MsZfSop5M_0l56yEKuN7Ug,aMP9YyQbzcxXTGkWEy1kvg,RSrBPqSze2HJkx5DZsm7FA,5.0,0,Yes very nice both the Service and food plus the cost was reasonable . Thank you again kali jo for the service. You will be seeing us again
HPXLtMYWz5x6Y0VeXXehmg,aMP9YyQbzcxXTGkWEy1kvg,yjcIKn2T2QY_DjXWACsAFw,5.0,0,going there for a movie is fun . The popcorn is great however the food is not so good and kinda expensive. But worst of all is the service once you get your order it takes forever to get your server to come back for a refill on your drink or perhaps more catsup or even refill on your popcorn which is supposed to be all you can eat. Then there right on about getting your bill (of course) just about ruined the comfortable chairs and great sound system that for me anyway but YES I'll go back but we're not gonna eat there and thinking of bringing water bottles In my wife's purse.
ZI_5XZW-hEXOy_NwozjoPw,wl7VR72-u8ADycZAwGC8gQ,9xm4aIAT_xwRoTxc0_8AWQ,5.0,1,"We just stayed here for 6 nights.  The highlight of our stay was the morning breakfasts, and the staff.  Excellent customer service, friendly, and very efficient.  Our room was clean, and kept that way by the great housekeeping staff.  The heat and air conditioning worked flawlessly, and we really liked the amenities in our room.  The room was spacious, we used the fridge to store drinks, but found ourselves frequenting the complimentary soda during the evening hours, a very nice touch.  There is also a food kiosk available 7/24 at the front desk, another nice feature.  There was a big group of team volleyball players that kept the place hopping on Friday and Saturday.  The staff kept up, keeping things stocked and clean during the busy hours.  There was a bit of noise from all the kids, doors slamming, running in the halls, and general loud voices.  To be expected with the weekend crowds.  All was quiet after 10pm, thankfully.  Our TV worked great, we really liked the convenient outlets in the room.  Great for charging all of our electronics.  I know this hotel is on the lower end of the luxury spectrum, but we had a really good experience here.  One thing we felt could make the hallways quieter was some sound absorbing wall coverings, maybe some canvas pictures etc.  That was our only critique, and really it was a very small one."
Q3QeaElCPucDWOeiht7seA,wl7VR72-u8ADycZAwGC8gQ,lhsQkb5nhf-Kd5OvgB9MNg,5.0,1,"We had an excellent meal here during our recent stay in Tucson. The staff was very friendly and the sushi was fantastic. The server even turned the televisions onto an NFL playoff game so we could follow our team. The edamame was crisp and steaming hot when it came out, and the four custom sushi rolls we had filled us up and was fresh as can be. We also enjoyed a couple glasses of wine, and had some green tea ice cream to boot. The atmosphere here is very cozy, and we were able to relax during our meal."
M1XotRzFPNtiSjAPLNwPJQ,wl7VR72-u8ADycZAwGC8gQ,733MFsA_zzEY9RzKWJPDBg,5.0,1,"This is a beautiful park, albeit a quick trip through if you are not hiking or camping.  We stopped at the visitors center to grab some commemorative swag and to check in with our America the Beautiful Pass.  We weren't stopping to recreate, so it didn't really seem necessary, but we stopped anyhow.  The rangers at this location we very friendly and super knowledgeable, especially Sarah Officer...she took extra time to tell us about all of the local bike friendly areas, and we really appreciated it.  For the best view, step outside and take a pano picture of the nearby Saguaro forest.  It is impressive.  We were just passing through, and will take more time and possibly camp nearby in the future."
_8otZ5jX3ixRd_ALKEOStw,wl7VR72-u8ADycZAwGC8gQ,-y587EqqV-Pn6J631bROFg,3.0,0,"This convenience store/gas station was right across the street from our hotel.  We grabbed some water for our mountain bike ride, and the service was quick and friendly.  I don't usually frequent AM/PM because of the .35 charge to use my debit card...but it was close.  The entry/exit was fairly easy, so we were able to get in and out quickly."
AbgdeunKbImlWumC-UHcIA,wl7VR72-u8ADycZAwGC8gQ,F9BES1HFD3BkIudUe4oTgg,5.0,1,"We visited here today 1/14/17 and really enjoyed ourselves.  The admission was $31 for two adults, and worth the three hours we spent checking out all the cool displays.  I can't accurately convey all of the cool aviation history here, suffice to say it is vast.  If you go, don't miss the B17 hangar with all of the 570th Bombing Group memorabilia.  It is an incredible insight into the odds that were faced by the flight crews of these beautiful flying machines.  We have been to the Air and Space Museum in San Diego, as well as several other aviation displays and air shows.  The other highlight of this museum is the number of outdoor static displays.  Helicopters, jets, prop planes...it is all here and you can get up close and personal with all of them.  My personal highlight aside from the B-17 was actually getting close enough to walk under...and touch, the SR-71 on display here.  Be sure to leave yourself at least 4 hours to see it all.  There is a reason they sell a 2 day admission for $20...there is just so much to see, touch, and experience.  It is difficult to see it all in one visit.  Also, make sure to schedule your visit during the week, as Monday through Friday there are Boneyard tours available for an extra $7.  We visited on a Saturday so we couldn't take advantage of this, but it looks amazing as well.  If you like aviation, especially WWII history, make this museum a must see visit on your itinerary.  You won't be disappointed."
DGcJoa40m_QnZJVjLw3arw,wl7VR72-u8ADycZAwGC8gQ,PTnahBSnLT1jeok9tmedHA,5.0,0,"We were in town on a recent vacation and ate here twice.  We really enjoy the Olive Garden and your menu...especially the salads and breadsticks.  This location had great staff, and we had Brittney wait on us during our first visit, and Andrea during our second visit.  The food and service both times were great.  We had beer and wine, and my wife also had a lemon drop.  The bar staff here rocks...they made great cocktails with excellent flavor.  We also learned that some of the drinks were 50% off if you were waiting for a table, what an unexpected bonus!  I had the shrimp scampi with angel hair our first night, and the steak medallions with gorgonzola cheese and linguine.  Both dishes were out of this world, great flavor and just the right amount of pasta.  We had tiramisu the first night and skipped dessert the second night, just too full of the great food.  We enjoy the OG, and will visit again the next time we are in town."
th9zfwPTk3S1IwvCY10RCw,wl7VR72-u8ADycZAwGC8gQ,ZXaePy9NYj3QRge8yn7w2g,5.0,0,"As others have said, for a fixed point grill inside of a museum, the food here is excellent.  We had a Chicken Caesar salad, a Reuben sandwich, side of fries, Mountain Dew, and a Bud Light for $27.  I have read the other reviews complaining about the high prices here, but it is competitive with other area restaurants and the convenience of eating onsite trumps the other options.  Our food was prepared to order, and served hot and fresh.  My french fries were a very healthy portion that we actually couldn't finish.  You order your hot food directly from the line cook and he gives you a voucher which you hand to the cashier.  Our food was ready in about 7 minutes and delivered to our table.  Be sure to check out the wall display of all of the service pieces from airlines of the 60's/70's/80's.  We spent a good 15 minutes reminiscing about the days of past when you could actually eat a mediocre meal at 30,000 feet with a complimentary swizzle stick.  Kids who don't know what that is NEED to visit this exhibit inside the Flight Grill.  Well worth the 5 star rating I am throwing here, thanks for the great food and service."
RmvjTKjErJi-AbsRObvBIQ,wl7VR72-u8ADycZAwGC8gQ,DQqW9FqDet0EF-FWzIwLug,5.0,1,"This trail system was amazing!!  We rode our mountain bikes here after finding the trail system listed on MTB Project...and boy, are we glad we did.  We rode the Bunny Loop, Snake Dance, and Bunny's Revenge the first day, about a 7 mile set of loop trails that were very well marked, and obviously lots of care and maintenance on these desert trails.  We rode two weekdays and a Friday here, and the trails were only really busy on Friday mid-morning.  Plentiful and easily accessed parking was available.  What impressed us the most was the many cool trail signs, and desert knick nacks that were used as either memorials, or trail markers.  The trails were easy to find and route each time we rode.  The second day we entered the trail system from the north and rode Lone Cactus Loop, which was more of a blue trail with some fun ups and downs.  Definitely a better workout on that trail than the Bunny Loop, but the lower loops would be a great warm up to link with the northern trails.  Again, Lone Cactus Loop was very well marked and maintained.  There was one section that was especially challenging and it was aptly signed ""Half Pipe.""  I loved it, but my wife didn't enjoy some of the steeps as much.  We have ridden everywhere, from Moab to Sedona, and many places in California.  These trails we would highly recommend to visiting folks who may have never ridden in the desert or want to just get a good work out in.  They were a great introduction to the area, so much so that we didn't really seek out any other trails.  5 stars for sure, and just ride these great trails and have fun!!!"
U5jYKJ7ng9v8vrZro2Tn0A,wl7VR72-u8ADycZAwGC8gQ,qvlcna5bw8Y2C3s1LaFoXw,5.0,0,"What is not to love about JM?  This location was no exception, and my wife and I stopped by to have some fresh deli after a mountain bike ride.  She ordered a #7 and I had the #13 Mike's Way.  Both were made fresh and to order, and the staff even delivered our sandwiches to our table...boom, 5 Star customer service there!!  We had the combos, and our food, chips, and drinks were perfect!!  Thanks JM's, we love your consistently great sandwiches and above and beyond service!!"
37FluYLjldrs81t85Q41gQ,wl7VR72-u8ADycZAwGC8gQ,s1p9pg69MZA7vRiFCewQlQ,4.0,0,"We stopped here based upon reading the Yelp reviews...and we were not disappointed.  The location was in downtown Tucson, so after lunch and drinks we stopped by to grab some tire sealant.  I also picked up a couple of water bottles to commemorate our visit to Tucson, as unfortunately, the shop tech didn't have any shop stickers.  Hey guys...stock up...we just want to promote your business during our return trip to San Diego!!  Shop stickers are an easy and cheap way to say ""F-yeah we were there, and you should go to!""  Nate gave us some trail advice for Mt. Lemmon, and we picked up some of the trail maps available at the front of the shop.  Cool eclectic place."
bB3ndg3ThSVg9AF80WSMvw,wl7VR72-u8ADycZAwGC8gQ,MDNXo_6wMUkbv2_W3GOW7A,4.0,2,"Great food and service here.  Baily was our server, and we enjoyed our time here.  She read our pace well, and delivered our beers and food without pestering us.  We did play a few games first to kill some time, but my wife and I were really here to watch our team play football.  They have a great way to organize the screens here, assigning numbers and games to a screen so you can choose your seating accordingly.  Very cool.  Baily brought us appetizers, beers, entrees, and finally a delicious dessert.  Great service during the three hour course of the football game.  The only buzz kill for me was the VR game directly across from our booth, that was filled with overly stimulated kids screaming with their goggles on.  Unplug that game and I'll cap this review off with that elusive fifth star...I'm serious.  Thanks Baily, we appreciated your great service while we watched the game.  We will be back."
pJMykfmHWKujCVVyJubcpQ,wl7VR72-u8ADycZAwGC8gQ,fWeWzB9STxcX40AgSEQVcw,5.0,1,"This place is truly amazing.  We love the desert, and weren't sure what this experience would be after reading about the museum online.  We were pleasantly surprised, and our expectations were high after paying $41 for two adult admissions.  Our first stop was the reptile enclosure where we met two docents, one with a King Snake, and the other with a live tarantula.  They were extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  We walked outside and headed to check out the mountain lion next.  We were not expecting the glass viewing area to be so close, and after peeking in were greeted by the very friendly mountain lion.  This was the highlight of the visit for me, as I have seen cougars in the wild, but never this close.  It was a bit frightening at first, because I mean this is a big cat.  He/she paced and rubbed their face against the glass, very domestic cat like.  We sat transfixed for at least 15 minutes.  Such a beautiful animal and obviously accustomed to human attention.  We fell in love with this beautiful cat, and finally tore away to check out the other exhibits.  The brown bear was nowhere to be seen, as well as the Mexican Gray Wolf.  The Bighorn Sheep exhibit was another great show, as we got to see the big ram and his ewes climb and strut about their enclosure.  Then we made our way to the Javelinas, what a cool little group of ""not pigs.""  Next up were the coyotes, such beautiful and majestic animals.  It was really nice to see all of these animals in such natural settings, not at all zoo like.  Oh, failed to mention the bobcat, beavers, and porcupine.  As well as the hummingbird aviary, do not miss that.  Such a cool little area and we got some really cool photos of them as they zipped about and landed on branches with nectar feeders.  The walkways and pathways wind around beautiful natural desert landscapes, and seeing as how it had just rained, the smell of the fresh creosote filled the air.  A perfect day here that exceeded our expectations."

We were there for a week For a long stay I can recommend this hotel it was perfect for our needs and I have never been in a hotel with the hotel staff was so pleasant and courteous My husband and I were moving to Tucson and needed a place to stay while we looked  for a house again this hotel fit all of our needs And the best thing of all they have 24 hour coffee yes there is a coffee pot in the room with the full-size refrigerator and cooking top I nice sized microwave but it was nice to walk down the hall to the 24 hour coffee spot
9FOCqRCyOZ-qvShJPEeaZw,iQnNxuxBEGb5NJBBRK-LVQ,TWwN0AzD_GhAw9_ikBE7dQ,4.0,0,I had lasagna and it was excellent my husbands dish was equally as nice and good he ordered it off the lunch menu which we were surprised with how large the portions are  it is a beautifully appointed restaurant and we we have enjoyed ourselves quite a bit.  My husband refers to it as casual chic. We definitely will be back again

3Wk0IYI4OpEYWnRGtoj6qA,iQnNxuxBEGb5NJBBRK-LVQ,oe_mNXHcqx_NTKL6YCfw4A,4.0,1,I had stopped in with friends for lunch. Had a really good Reuben sandwich and took two pieces of their apple rhubarb pie  to take home for after dinner that night. It was great my only complaint is that the café itself is noisy but the food I felt it was worth the price.
iMRUHGk-IljKIPh_N89FFQ,iQnNxuxBEGb5NJBBRK-LVQ,14QP5lOdrTAVVCDDuHIAUg,4.0,0,We just moved to Tucson and friends here said we had to try this restaurant.  The tamales were good and freshly made my husband had a Barito which he just loved.   I ordered the spicy black beans and they were perfect just enough spice and beans were not overcooked.  You will not be disappointed with the quality of the food

uR_QdxDFTFcIJNEW3y7k5g,iQnNxuxBEGb5NJBBRK-LVQ,pBmQtL6jj3FQ-ZI4MsMQQA,4.0,9,"My husband and I moved to Tucson Meadows in December of 2015, and in the short time we have lived here we have found the nicest people you could wish for as neighbors.  The park is located near almost all your needs. The Tucson public transportation is just outside the gate (I am still trying to figure the bus system out). When we looked at the house we did buy the first thing I said was ""Would I be embarrass to bring friends into the park"" The answer is no, it is a lovely place. The clubhouse is nice and clean, cheerful, a little dated but still a great place to have friend over for a swim (like you are going to get me in a bathing suit) and meet others in the park. Management is friendly and will work with you. We live here year round  and love it."

Ub06KIuOYnTTB51CsPZS7g,cBbVbcqUWrgYLP-06v0UXA,9xm4aIAT_xwRoTxc0_8AWQ,3.0,8,"There is a lot to like about the TownePlace Suites by Marriott Tucson Airport. Their location is a bit tough being next to the airport, but far away from most attractions in Tucson. This is an extended stay hotel with studio suites catering to the local business travelers and contractors in the immediate area. The hotel is tucked back off Valencia in a small office park.  The public areas are very nice here. The pool lacks a hot tub, but has a grill and a nice elegant look. The large lobby doubles as the breakfast and evening social area with a nice English muffin bar on my trip and good hot sauces. I did not sample the evening meals, but they are probably useful due to a lack of restaurants in the area.  The rooms are nice although a little cramped. My king suite had a good sized bathroom and bed, although the modern Marriott sofa was a bit uncomfortable. The suite has a full refrigerator and dishwasher with an electric stove and cooking utensils making cooking much easier. The closest grocery store is a Walmart up the road in a rough part of town which may scare most white collar business types.  Nevertheless, my stay at the TownePlace Suites was a good option. Airport noise is only an issue when the fighter jets take off which lots of noise, but this is not at night. If you are visiting places like Tombstone, Sonoita Wine County, Patagonia, etc., this is a good location to avoid Tucson traffic, although the hotel is a decent drive from the freeway."
MYwYYSunFRC7N42AvxS_Sg,cBbVbcqUWrgYLP-06v0UXA,tV46IhCfHbsx_af-pMupiw,5.0,9,"Cafe Poca Cosa has long been one of my favorite dining destinations. The concept of gourmet Mexican food has not had much traction in the United States due to many factors, but their chef takes many traditional dishes and presents them with a unique upscale flair. The restaurant is located underneath one of the city parking garages in downtown Tucson along Pennington right next to the main staircase and elevators.  The interior is very modern, elegant, and very dark. You could really get away with a lot of stuff under the table here, but most diners are too busy above the table with the excellent food. They have the requisite chips and salsa, but they are only average and mainly a distraction. Cafe Poca Cosa has a full and popular bar with many high end margaritas and other cocktails.  Unless you have a strong preference, just order the Poca Cosa Platter. This is a chef's choice meal with three options that are done on a whim. The portions are huge and enough to share between two people. My platter included grilled steak, chili relleno with mole, and sweet corn tamale with a cabbage salad and rice and beans. Everything was excellent except for the black beans which seemed a little off.  Prices are very reasonable given the quality and presentation. Service is as expected for a high end restaurant. This is a great place to impress your date or even more difficult, a Yelper! Do not expect a taco and enchilada combination plate at Cafe Poca Cosa. Open your mind to the flavors and styles of Mexico and place your night in the hands of the talented chef."
-I5nZ90h3Jj3Hs0shH3cHQ,cBbVbcqUWrgYLP-06v0UXA,F9BES1HFD3BkIudUe4oTgg,5.0,6,"This place is almost too big with too many aircraft. The Pima Air & Space Museum is a massive complex on the southeastern part of Tucson next to the Air Force base. They are accessed from Valencia and Interstate 10 with ample covered parking under a large solar power array.  You begin in one of the indoor hangars with a large selection of military and civilian aircraft. You can easily spend hours here with several indoor exhibits and a very large outdoor area with dozens of aircraft including a Boeing 787 prototype and several presidential planes.  There is a large indoor exhibit dedicated to the space program including some cool artifacts. Some of the exhibits have a bit of a bias and are somewhat dated, but overall there are some great displays. This is also home to the Arizona aviation hall of fame.   It can easily get very hot here with little shade outside. I recommend pacing yourself between inside and outside exhibits. The museum is great for families and aviation buffs. Admission is a bit expensive, but it is a good place to spend the day.  Tucson has a lot to offer locals and tourists alike. Pima Air & Space Museum is a great addition to your adventure and the area."
ngqVlhO4MNH0reJUvT8_kg,cBbVbcqUWrgYLP-06v0UXA,OxBZqeYH5xuusEPp9ml7-g,4.0,5,"You're probably reading this thinking about hot dogs. El Guero Canelo has a well earned reputation for the Sonoran Hot Dog, but this basic taqueria in South Tucson has a expanded menu including burritos and tacos. Parking is limited, but decent.  The Sonoran Hot Dogs are amazing. Bacon wrapped hot dogs served with beans, peppers, onions, and mayo served in a soft and fresh bun are really better than the sum of their parts. The base dog is large with all the toppings.  I also tried the daily special of carne asada tacos with soda. The meat was generous with fresh tortillas. Their condiments are equally impressive with fresh roasted onions and jalapeños along with any number of salsas.  The interior feels straight out of Mexico with a large indoor seating area and counter ordering area. This is not a fancy place pampering their customers, but the overall feel is festive and open for those willing to visit the area.  This is the place for Sonoran Hot Dogs in Tucson and maybe Arizona.

The Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum is tucked behind the Tucson Mountain Park and surrounded by the Saguaro National Monument, so you know you are in for a treat. Access is a bit remote requiring a drive through the park from Tucson or a long detour though cotton fields when heading from Phoenix. Where do you think Pima Cotton comes from?  The museum is a free form open botanical garden and zoo with many enclosures and exhibits designed to showcase the various ecological parts of the desert. They do an excellent job of presenting the unique nature of the area and really bring a deeper appreciation for what many think is a wasteland.  As you would expect, this place heats up quickly even during cooler months. I highly recommend visiting early in the day, although the winter months may make late afternoons easier. It would be tough to truly appreciate the museum during the summer due to the intense heat. Fortunately, there are a lot of water and sunscreen stops and several shade structures to escape the heat.  The museum also has a restaurant, food court, and several gift shops. My lunch was above average, but nothing spectacular. It is your only real option due to the remote location. The shops offer a nice collection of Native Art and other desert items to impress the folks back home.  I highly recommend visiting here early and often. If you are in Tucson, you owe it to yourself to include the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum in your trip to experience the beauty of the desert. You will be amazed."

My husband and I have been donating plasma at the Tucson location since recovering from COVID in May of 2020.  We have seen the decline in service, the increase of wait times, the lines grow longer and longer, and the staff become less  and less kind, gentle, friendly, and efficient, in the last 18 months. They allow too many people to schedule donations without the staff to support that large number of people.  We have had many issues over the course of these 18 months, but it just keeps getting worse.  Today my regular donation, on a Wednesday afternoon, took 3 HOURS!!  Who has 3 hours in a row?  I asked for a lead phlebotomist today, because my veins can roll sometimes, and was not given one.  Had another senior attempt to fix the poor ""stick"" unsuccesfully and then had to move to the other arm with a good stick, finally, from the other lead.  Overall, customer service is way down, and wait times are way up.  I have referred a few friends here but not any more.  I don't blame the regular staff completely, they are overworked.  Management is unsympathetic, and unavailable.  I also had to get my proteins checked recently and could not donate until they received the results.  I was told it would be 7-14 days.  I called after 10 days, since I had not heard from them, but no one called me back.  After 14 days, I went to make a donation and now I will not be able to fulfill by bonus because I lost 2 weeks of donations.  Very unsatisfied!"

After going through an unfourtanate event in my life and learning new ways how to cope with my PTSD the only thing that kept me going was exercise so I could completely exhaust myself to actually get a few hours of sleep at night.  However that wasnt enough motivation for me and I needed a healthier lifestyle.  I was restless and not eating properly.

To set the scene, it was a Tuesday night in a college town with no real games on TV and the restaurant was about 50% full with business. We thought we were off to a good start coming here... 4-star Yelp reviews, a spunky greeting from the waitress and prompt beer delivery. The positive experience stops there. We ordered the chicken skewers and mozzarella sticks to start... but apparently they thought we were ending with our starter too. It took 30 min. for the appetizers to reach our table. When they finally came out, we were given the sticks but also pickle spears (not what we ordered) so they took those back. The chicken skewers were finally delivered in another 15 min. but by then were hangry and wanting to leave. We concluded our dining experience at the Trident as soon as we could and headed over for some ice cream to soothe the remaining hunger pangs."

Like others have explained - the menu is quickly delivered via chalk board by your server. Our server reviewed the menu ""muy rapida"" and with just enough Spanish inflection to make you either think she's authentic or wonder what the heck she just said (I could read the menu en español, she was just really impatient with anyone who asked questions about it).   The food was good but not ""OMFG what did I ever think was good food before I had this meal"" good. I opted for the mystery platter which happen to consist of a fish/calamari in tomato sauce/tomatoes pouch; pile of shredded beef and a roll of polenta with cream sauce and a garden's worth of greenery. Each bite was really good but in all honesty, I would rather have had street tacos from some food truck. Their chips & salsa were also nothing to ruin your appetite about. The only good thing about them being there was to help soak up a margarita... which leads me to drinks!   Drinks - pretty darn good, and what's best is that you can order margaritas by the pitcher for an overall cost-savings of~$15-20 depending on what type you get. And when a margarita cost like $9 for a basic variety, that's bargain city! Their wine is about $11/glass and I also heard great things about their sangria but didn't try.   Now, take my review for what it is... I don't have anywhere to compare it to in the Tucson area but if I were to spend a lot on a good dinner, it probably wouldn't be on high-end taco ingredients."

While the corn tortilla reminded me of a flour tortilla I found myself drawn more to the flavor of the flour tortilla. However, texture and char was good on both. The abodabo was really good, the barbacoa on the other hand was a bit unfamiliar and strange to me. It took a bit of doctoring up with condiments from the  salsa bar for me to thoroughly enjoy it. Rice and beans sides were yummy. Would come back, especially for the salsa bar (chips were good too, btw), but looking forward to trying other Mexican fare in Tucson."

The first employee interaction was just outside the front door with the employee that was in the way while dicking about with his phone and blowing smoke at us. When we entered there were no other customers but plenty of staff, one was staring blankly at a calculator, the next was dicking about with his phone, the next was watching a fight on the big ole TV, not one of them stopped what they were doing to greet us and they continued doing the same things the whole time we were there. Finally a woman came out of the back and told us to sit anywhere and gave us some odd menus.  1700/5pm is when they open. We arrived shortly after, yet the garbage can in the women's bathroom was completely full and overflowing on to the ground. Three of the people working in the kitchen were wearing flip flops.   This close to opening I would expect everything to plentiful and fresh, especially at a seafood restaurant. So sorry, we are out of beer, lemons and only have one pound of green muscles. As we were ordering she kept having to go in the back to see if they had what we were ordering. The sodas came in warm cans served with a plastic cup, no ice. The iced tea came in a warm plastic bottle with a plastic cup, no ice.   We were then served a basket of awful, stale bread rolls with frozen butter.  When our food finally came, all that checking to see if they had what we wanted to order took a while, I was unable to eat much of mine. I am told that the green mussels were good, as were the shrimp and one order of crab legs. The clams and my order of crab legs were awful. They smelled off when they arrived, were not fresh, the shells were soft and the meat stuck to the insides of them.  Our group member with the cast iron stomach wanted to take them home to make crab salad with so I asked to have them packed to go. They dumped everything in the bowl (lots of liquid and sharp pointy shells) into a single plastic grocery bag.  Two members of our group were sick for days after.  We have been blessed to enjoy many excellent locally owned restaurants here in Tucson, this was not one of them."
_loyjtL8eRRmAoVf0HZAmg,_-SjDVit-tv9nl4qFtltZQ,,5.0,1,"We had dinner here last weekend for my sister's birthday. So good! Let me start at the front door. I am in a wheelchair but we didn't have to worry about the door. When we got there it was already open and waiting, held by a server. The space is fancy. Just inside is a water feature with a man holding two vessels, to the right is the bar area, and to the left is the host stand. We didn't even have to slow my chair, the hostess was already on the move, and she didn't assume we'd want a table rather than a booth due to the chair. The first person to the table brought water and explained that she had short arm syndrome(her words) so it would be easier for us to pass to the back. The staff here is amazing really amazing. She came back with hot flat bread, my mom said she saw them cooking it, butter fresh herbs, and onion. She took the time to explain the traditional way to prepare and eat it. Our server was great and so patient. She didn't try to rush us and answered our many question thoughtfully. There was always someone near. We never had to wait for a person to come to the table.        Along with the flat bread and greens, we started with the hummus. It was so fresh and no one flavor over powered the dish, it was just right. We finally ordered, with more help from our wonderful waitress. I ordered the Chicken Barg, my sister had the Beef Barg, and my dad had the Lamb Shish Kebab, each came with a grilled tomato, lemon, and white basmati rice topped with saffron basmati rice(there are about a dozen other fancy rice you can order with a upcharge). My mom grazed on everything. The flavors are amazing everything is harmonious. There is no one note that drowns out the rest. They build off each other. The portions are HUGE! The plates served look exactly like the pictures in the menu and online. Even with the grazing by mom and the sampling of each others meals, I ate six meals including @ the restaurant from what I ordered. They even brought out baklava with a birthday candle for my sister.       We tried out a fancy cocktail too. The Cloud Nine was yummy and strong, but not meant for sipping, some of the ingredients are heavier and settle if you drink it too slow.       As I said at the beginning this place is fancy. Let's start at the top. There are many lovely chandelier, that twinkle against the ceiling, painted to resemble the night sky. There is art everywhere, paintings on the walls, on the extended privacy screens between booths. The furniture looks and feels lavish. The name is Persian Room Fine Dining. Just looking at the website gets this across. I called to ask if there was any kind dress requirement. They replied that they were a fine dining establishment and hope their guests honor that. There are always some that don't care though. We didn't get super dressy but we put in a little more effort than we would anywhere else.        The place is so clean and smells so good, even before you open the door. They have an area in the dining room where they make and cook the flat bread and you can also see into the kitchen, white glove passed.       Even the lady's room was fancy and best of all wheelchair friendly. There is marble and faceted subway tile on the walls and small iridescent tiles on the floor. once again I cheer their wheelchair accessibility, I could easily reach the sink and operate the faucet(cool faucets, too), and cleanser.       I really love this place and when in the area I will gravitate toward this wonderful place.       I think the butter would work better at room temperature and I am told the onion could be sweeter. I think some signage to direct patrons would help, too. This is not the most visible location. I also saw some tank tops and jeggings amongst the employees, none with the staff that interacted with us specifically.        There is a happy hour, on their site under the About Us it says "" Join us for happy hour Tuesday through Friday, 4-8 pm as we give away the best hummus in the Valley for free and reduce prices on our wine, beer, and expert cocktails. There is also a lunch menu."

I live outside Tucson to the southwest no where near a Cracker Barrel. During the summer CB runs a special campfire menu and I LOVE the campfire beef. I planned a special trip to the CB in Marana just for this menu item. I even called ahead to make sure it was still on the menu and available, I was told yes to both. So an hour later, still during lunch, I happily order my campfire beef. Five minutes after that the waitress comes out to tell me they have run out and will not get anymore until the next truck comes in the following day. They run out of a special menu item half way through lunch....Then they smile and laugh and tell me how they ALWAYS run out of the beef first. If that's the case order more, learn how to use a build to, something. Too bad for anyone hoping to have campfire beef for dinner.  It was a disappointing trip all the way around. The corn bread and biscuits were burned. the campfire chicken I ended up ordering was supposed to be a plump half chicken with lovely red sweet tea glaze. What I got was half a starving pigeon covered with some sticky blackness with no flavor whatsoever and mushy carrots."

She  may have made some mistakes, but she was so friendly and tried to  rectifiy any issues.   Lets start with what pissed me off the worst. An elderly woman came in by herself. The man-ish that was seating her did not stay with her but rocketed away and then stood there and tapped his foot on the ground and slapped the menus on his hand. When she finally catches up and gets a look at the table she has been directed to, she told him she did not want that table. As she turns around to look at what is available she sees one she likes. The sever/host walked along behind her rolling his eyes and making faces.   I saw a server complain to a diner that they didn't give her enough a big enough tip. She moved closer to the table blocking his ability to rise and exit the booth.   When our food arrived the orders were not complete and the portions were half the size than served at other locations. For example I ordered a short stack, normally the pancakes come on their own regular size plate. The cakes arrived on a side size plate w/ lots of nekkid room around the edge. I sent them back and when new ones came...same sized plate w/ a little less room around the rim. Half my order didn't arrive until the pancakes were remade. Papa's order came out in waves and he asked for Tabasco when we gave our order so she didn't have to try to carry it and our order, it didn't come before or w/ our order. It took her about 10 minutes to find it. I am still waiting for my food. How long does it take to cook two pancakes, especially in a restaurant semi devoted to pancakes.  There was a man sitting in a booth right up at the front. He was making very nasty faces and gestures mainly to the employees. He had papers spread all over the table. When things started back up did he get up and help? No there was just more faces and flailing."

I think I can hold it next time. At least long enough to have my after lunch vanilla malt. They still use the powder not the syrup, it makes them taste so much better. The syrup makes them too sweet. I was having a bad day and had to have a procedure to get a wandering implant removed. It was NOT wonderful and so painful. The employees seemed to pick up on that and give me a little extra care. It would be great if the employees had name tags on so I could thank each one a name at a time."
FiBcHukVFaJwvYQOwBEXBA,_-SjDVit-tv9nl4qFtltZQ,eTCDxZd5QUj2kBrBMbnbTQ,1.0,0,"To start let me tell you, we love Little Anthony's. We live in another town west of Tucson yet we make it in at least once a month.  Tuesday we were celebrating my dad's birthday and he wanted to go have ice cream. We were there around late lunch time, 2-3ish. It was packed w/ a waiting line, since we were just there for ice cream we sat at the counter. There were all kinds of mask issues. The main one in the dining room was masks on servers worn only covering the mouth. At the register and behind the counter some of the servers would pull their masks down around their chins, management too. There was only one person wearing a mask in the kitchen. They do provide sanitizer for all, there are bottles on every table, up and down the counter, and at the doors.  My issue starts w/ a server named Taylor. She was asked to help make a Big Bopper shake for one of her tables. The person working the counter/ice cream had never made one before and w/ it so busy it was not the time for a lesson. From the moment Taylor was asked she copped attitude about it, huffing and slamming things around. These shakes really do seem to take way too long to make, even if it was slow. There are signs in the prep area, clean as you go this area must be clean at all times. Yes, it was very busy. When Taylor finished she left everything a mess and didn't close or put away any of the ingredients. Exit Taylor, end of that issue.   The following is my huge issue...  The ingredients are still sitting out on the counter open. One of the servers reaches out as she is walking by a storage container of sugar wafer touches everything on the top layer(at least), grabs a wafer and breaks it in half. She drops the other half back in and walks away. When I saw her do this I immediately said, that's disgusting. The server must not have heard and just kept on going. I asked one of the others behind the counter if they had seen. They said yes but there was nothing they could do about it. I saw this server working tables inside and outside so on top of the regular things they were touching they had to repeatedly handle the door pulls. I also saw her as she walked behind the counter and she did not sanitize her hands.  I went up to talk to a manager. Turns out she was a manager. Her name is Lynn. I told her what I saw her do. That it was disgusting that she would place her dirty hands on food to be served. Especially now(again), with Covid numbers rising(again) and the new variant(again). She is directly endangering the customers, a lot who seem older and families. At first she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. I was 2 feet away with a clear line of sight. She said she was sorry, but seemed surprised and somewhat offended that I found her behavior disgusting. She turned and went into the back. All the ingredients are still sitting out on the counter...five to ten minutes later she comes out, refusing to look at me, and closes the container of sugar wafers and takes it with her to the back. You would think that they seem to share the parking lot w/ a Pima County Health Department office they would be more careful.  There were also a couple of off the clock employees holding court at the kitchen end of the counter, despite how busy it was.  In the interest of getting it all out, this place has the worst handicap bathrooms."

Maybe I built it up too high in my head. Just parking was a big hurdle, very little parking for all the businesses in the strip and it is all on one end, the opposite end from 1702. The spaces are small as well and because of people not reading the signs it is like playing Chicken and Musical Chairs at the same time.  The décor is the same as most fast casual restaurants. Just like Monkey Burger, Graze on Broadway, Chuy's on Valencia.  I ordered a pepperoni slice and a King Harbor Lucy Foss Hibiscus Pale Ale (Pink Boots Society Hop Blend) and my Dad got the meatball sub and water. Drinks first, the water tasted metallic, and beer and soda were all flat. I can't say the food was bad, it just was. It was there and we ate it, but it was bland, bland and more bland. They also need to leave the slices in long enough to crisp up the toppings and melt the cheese all the way.  There we're other people there, some were treated as regulars, that seemed to love the food they were served, so maybe it takes more than one visit to learn to love it.  It was all disappointing, except for the staff, and that made me sad."

I think they could do away with about half the packaging that now comes wrapped around the various food items, especially for the dine in orders. They do have paper straws rather than plastic ones. They have separate garbage and recycling containers, but all the waste left at the end of the meal had come into contact with multiple food products that made recycling a no go.

I used to wax at Euro -which I LOVE- and a few other places that I would try out every so often. I loved the wax at Euro but my in-growns began to get a bit more agitated and using all kinds of treatments did not help so I sought a better solution and found laser.  I saw a Groupon first for the store. I called New Looks before I bought the Groupon to ask what type of laser and if the technician was certified and has experienced. I was really excited when I found out she not only had all of her certifications and had years of practice, she was also a pharmacist! That is VERY important because they are trained vigorously in Pharm school and understand the body and effects different chemicals have on it as well as doctors would. So I decided to go in to their place and buy the laser package from them.  I had my first visit at the Salon Wednesday, a few days back. It was GREAT. I know someone wrote that Hadeel was rushed in her service but I did not feel that way at all. She absolutely took her time, was meticulous, made sure to outline everything and constantly asked me if there was pain or what my tolerance was. I felt very comfortable with her and am really excited to go back in. I had originally taken out a package for below my knees and a Full Brazilian, but when I went in I decided to also do the underarms. The process was relaxed, she talked to me about school and was very friendly. I did not feel pressure to keep up conversation as the silence was also comfortable with her at times! Afterwards, she massaged aloe vera onto the areas we had treated and reminded me of post-laser conditions.   This place was professional, the staff courteous, Hadeel was knowledgeable, affable and I will continue ALL of my laser treatments here.

I went at varying times because my schedule is really hectic, so it was not to be able to go at any time. I enjoyed it while I was there until this happened: One night at around 3am, I was one of 6 people in the gym. One was an employee, the other a janitor, and the rest were patrons. I went into the bathroom, had just finished showering, came out in my towel and went to the mirror. I was lucky enough to have the janitor come up behind me and watch me for about 2 minutes. He did not announce himself, just strolled into the bathroom and stood there watching me. I did not know how to react; I am the type of person that freezes up and goes blank in unexpected, intimidating situations. I finished combing and putting up my hair and by that time he had gotten his fill of me and walked out. I reported it to management, even called the headquarters. Their response was abhorrent and their treatment worse. In the end, they told me they would cancel my membership and they were KIND ENOUGH to waive the cancellation fee, and they made sure to tell me they were doing ME a favor.  Ridiculous, unprofessional and beyond abysmal treatment."

The entire meal was on top of what I think was beans or ""seeds"" as they called on the menu, if I recall correctly.   It was sort of like a soup.  That's the part of it that I would have done differently but it did not detract from the rest.   My guests meals looked good.  I would definitely go back again next time I'm in Tucson."

First, the sushi is always fresh, I especially love getting the sashimi. The tuna is so tender and flavorful. The salmon is great too. I always get the jalapeño popper because its amazing. The texture and sauces blend together to make a really good appetizer. The rolls are good although I'm not always in the mood for the more adventurous deep fried rolls, but they're well done for what they are. The ambiance is cool too. Reminds me of a nightclub or something.   Anyway, this last trip, everything was the delicious. The drinks were good, the sushi was good and our server, Brooke was so friendly and attentive while still giving us space to enjoy our meal.   Is this the best sushi in town?

The food is impressive, but I'm a woman of simple taste first thing in the morning and much of it is a bit heavy for me. However, you can't go wrong with the avocado toast piled with fresh veg and a silky fried egg, or the classic breakfast with a side of the crispiest potatoes. If I get up early enough to beat the crowds I'll gladly go, but to me this place is not worth the lines that usually form after 9 or 10."

Gah! Those tots are extremely satisfying, and the corn cakes are moist but with a perfectly crisp edge and good chew.

I grew up on Maui, and while I may be a haole, this food tastes just like home and helps with the occasional homesickness. Great chicken katsu that came out steaming hot and so crispy and delicious, creamy macaroni salad here. I'll be back soon for the poke bowl which appears to be brimming with seaweed salad and crab salad. They also have popular Hawaiian packaged foods like Hawaiian Sun juice and all kinds of snack like li hing mui and mochi crunch. The hibiscus print chairs and classic island music playing really add to the vibe, too.   I like that the food comes in to-go containers because you aren't going to finish it in one sitting, but I'm docking a star because styrofoam makes me feel bad.

He was assessed and accepted into Paws Up! with no issue.  After he was neutered when he was about 7 months old we noticed issues with fear aggression.  We solicited consultations from four trainers, one being the owner of Paws Up!  She visited our home and experienced first hand our puppy's issues but never followed up at all.  Our puppy continued to go to Paws Up! with no issue or concerns mentioned by Paws Up!  We decided to send him to a Board and Train program with the last trainer we consulted with and he was gone for two months.  All the while Paws Up! was updated on his progress and return home by both email and in person.  On his second day home he went back to Paws Up! and by mid day I received an email from Mel (the best staff member they have) saying he should take a few weeks off to continue to train at home. There was no particular issue pointed out, but he had done ""fantastic"" with one of the handlers and had met 4 new handlers that morning.  He was also taken back in the morning with a large rope/lead by another new handler.   My trainer responded with a lengthy email explaining about our puppy's nature and what his training did and did not do in respect to daycare, with no immediate feedback from the owner.   I picked him up early and was very upset since he was so new home from his board and train my options for a new daycare could be limited.  I was then told that he had nipped staff members prior, which I had NEVER been told.  Communication went on the following day between me, my trainer and the owner and she shared concerns with ""negative experiences with our puppy and her staff and guest"" again I had NEVER been told.  For a while all daycare dogs received report cards.  I have a large stack of report cards wtih all A's and B's for our puppy with no mention ever of any negative experiences and/or nipping of anyone!  I opted to not return our puppy to Paws Up! and I emailed the owner and Mel my decision and thoughts and never heard back.  In a nutshell, many of the staff are caring and helpful.  No one is considerate  and experienced with dogs that need some extra time and TLC.  The grounds are spacious and the location and price were perfect for me.  The owners business manner is unethical and she is dishonest. I do not think her purpose at Paws Up! is for dogs and their well being nor is her knowledge of dog behavior what she markets it to be."

I was told about Anita's by a couple that I just married who were excited to try the bacon wrapped burrito. I have lived in Tucson for 14 years and had never heard of Anita's . My hubby just mentioned that had a write up in a local newspapers ""the  5 best"", so I thought I would give their bacon wrapped burrito a try this morning.   I documented my adventure on Facebook (as usual) especially for my wonderful couple from Iowa to experience.  I  requested my burrito without the cabbage and tomato on top. My burrito took just over ONE HOUR. The first one was given away to another customer. When I finally received my order, it had all of the toppings, no avocado and is not a fully fledged bacon wrapped burrito. It is basically a burrito with no more than four slices of bacon wrapped around it. The actual burrito itself was okay.  After I returned home, Anita's posted their news article on Facebook. I commented about my first visit being disappointing. They deleted my comment and messaged me on Facebook apologizing and explaining that all food is cooked fresh and if I return they will give me a free burrito.  The cashier tried her best. She was swamped and even said that my burrito was being deducted from her paycheck for some reason. She is the only reason that Anita's got any star rating from me.  I have tried Whataburro's bacon wrapped burrito. They offer 3 sizes and your choice of meat inside. Their burrito is completely wrapped in bacon. There is no tortilla. They made two fresh, medium size burritos for us in 20 minutes. Their burritos are excellent! Whataburro's  is 10 times better and I am disappointed that I did not go there today instead.  I will not return to Anita's. Free burrito or not."

I was the first puppy parent in the clinic and because of my puppy's vocal-ness I was told to sit outside!  I was very shocked.

I bought my youngest Weimaraner Oliver, at the time, to get neutered here and had a good experience and the price was more reasonable than my regular vet.  Oliver was recently bitten at doggie daycare.  I picked him up at daycare and took him straight to Pet Doctor. They were closed with a note on the door that they would be open in 2 hours. I took Oliver back home, went back to work and then returned home 2 hours later, picked him up and returned with Oliver and his new younger brother, so he would not have to be in this ""house"" (crate). The Weimaraners were a hit at the Pet Doctor and although the total wait was three hours, we visited with other pet parents.  The vet, Dr. Rapp, was gruff.  She was not warm and gentle. I had two Weimaraners with me, who are known as ""velcro"" dogs. She could not examine Oliver while he stood close to me, with his bite exposed to her. She had to pull him out into the middle of the room. He was scared and shaken up due to the bite.  Oliver was taken from the room to get a further examination and stitches.  When the vet returned she did not offer any details to me, I asked all the questions.  She did offer that ""Oliver was difficult"".  I asked why and she said ""he is over a 100 pound Weimaraner"". I said, ""yes he is, but he is easy to work with and is very well socialized"". She said, "" I hope you are working on that weight"". I was shocked.  Oliver has been on a weight loss effort for several months and he is 8 pounds short of his goal weight and actually looks very good.  He is a very tall Weimaraner!  After the long weight, two puppies and a long, emotional day, Dr. Rapp did not show any compassion toward Oliver.  The remainder of the staff were wonderful!"

He had already nipped a family friend and a neighbor and I had court issues resulting from the nip of the neighbor (which are still ongoing!)  Life with Hunter was getting very stressful but our love for him was well developed and our need for help was blatant.  We consulted with  three ""trainers"" prior to consulting with Anthony.  Our oldest Daughter had worked with Anthony in training our grand doggie pit bull, B0NES to become a service dog years prior, so she recommended Anthony to us.  By the time we consulted with Anthony, Hunter's need for help was very serious so we agreed that Hunter go to board and train with Anthony.  Originally Hunter was going for one month, but due to Hunter needing more time to warm up to Anthony his time was extended to two months.  It was a very hard time for us, but we knew that Hunter needed help and getting that help was the priority over our emotions in missing him. I cried many tears and feared Hunter would forget us.  Hunter returned home and we trained with Anthony upon his return.  Hunter had already significantly become conditioned.  We have trained ongoing with Anthony and have done all of our home work with Hunter, i.e,. place training and walking more regularly and his progress is beyond impressive.  Today was Hunter's first vet visit since he has been home from board and train and the visit went perfectly.  I had stressed for days about it and I am over the moon!  Our vet was impressed and asked for Anthony's business cards! Hunter's last pet visit had truly been the ""vet visit from hell""! (NOT exaggerating!)

Over the past couple months, though, the overall quality of the food has declined, even as the menu has expanded and appears to be more innovative. Example: several dishes include biscuits, and the past two times I've had them, they were either held too long in a steam table or microwaved (I don't know why they were so bad). Another: P&P was one of the few places in Tucson that really knew how to prepare an omelette, but the last two I ordered were overcooked, mediocre. Notice that I always try a bad dish at least once more, in case it's just the kitchen having a down day. So, after four passable, not-so-great breakfasts, I'll only go back, when a friend really wants to give it a try. And then, I'll keep my fingers crossed.

A friend, looking for something lighter and more healthful, had the grilled trout.

Brushfire BBQ, taking advantage of this cultural void, serves up barbecue from a variety of American traditions, offering most types of meat most commonly barbecued around the country - brisket, ribs, pork shoulder, chicken, and sausage. In addition, they're offering smoked-then-fried chicken wings, a relatively new and relatively rare entry into the barbecue arena. In addition, Brushfire offers a variety of sides, ranging from the traditional (corn on the cob, three varieties of coleslaw, and baked beans), to something more unusual (""Messy Fries,"" french fries topped with barbecued meat, sauce, and cheese).  I was there for lunch, and tried the brisket sandwich with hot sauce, and the vinegar coleslaw. The sandwich was served simply on a toasted roll loaded with slices of brisket doused with sauce. The brisket was nicely done, tender, and showing a nice pink smoke ring near the meat's surface. The sauce was slightly sweet, pleasantly hot without being at all overpowering (if I had wanted to be overpowered, however, there was a large selection of hot sauces on a shelf with which I could have doctored up my sandwich nicely). The slaw, tart and a little sweet, was fresh, crisp, and crunchy. I also had an order of the messy fries, topped with pork, Brushfire's Balsamic Bacon sauce (very good) and some shredded provolone cheese. The fries seem to be batter-dipped prior to frying, and are quite crisp and delicious. The barbecue topping turns them into an over-the-top appetizer or side.   The service is excellent - place your order at the counter and a server will bring it to your table when it's ready, which won't be long. The previously mentioned hot sauce bar is available at any time, and the tables are supplied with extra Brushfire Mild and Hot BBQ sauces, plenty of napkins, toothpicks, and wet-naps for your wiping pleasure. Prices are on the high end of the fastfood range, but are more than reasonable considering what you get. For the regular sandwich, slaw, messy fries, and a large soft drink, the cost was around 12 bucks. Parking is a bit of a pain, as the restaurant is right on a busy stretch of Campbell Ave with only a few parking spots right off the street, but it's hard to imagine how they could improve that.  If you're in Tucson, particularly if you're near the University, and you develop a hankerin' for some barbecue, you could do worse than to stop in at Brushfire BBQ."

Of course, other versions of the creation tale abound - there are almost as many as there are versions of the chimichanga itself. That notwithstanding, El Charro Cafe is known today for its carne seca, a meat staple which is made at the original (downtown) location, where racks of seasoned beef are hoisted high into the air to be dried by Tucson's arid breezes. The result is a jerky-like product which is rehydrated and served with tortillas, rice and beans, or as a component of burritos, tacos, or enchiladas. The flavor is superb, and the texture contributes to the overall interest of the dish. El Charro's carne seca plate is $8.00 at lunch, $14.00 at dinner.

My only complaint about this place is that the tables are the kind with fixed benches, and the bench-to-table dimension is a bit cramped for a person of  ""normal"" proportions such as myself. If you're some kind of a sub-300 pound stick person, you're not likely to notice any problem at all, but if you're generously proportioned, be prepared to develop a permanent belly-crease if you come here often.

I had the apple pancake. It was sublime. The apples were fresh, tart, and crispy, and their brown-sugar-butter-and-cinnamon glaze was perfectly caramelized by the massive grill. The pancake overhung the sides of the platter it was served on - I can't even imagine enjoying more than one. Alongside the pancake, on a separate plate where they could find room to relax, were found a couple of butter-fried eggs, expertly cooked over easy, two links of sausage, and two thick slices of bacon. Add a bottomless cup of fresh coffee, and it's still less than the price of a latte and a croissant at Starbucks. The one caveat I'd offer is that if your body's blood sugar regulation ability is suboptimal, you might want to be prepared to deal with that in whatever way your physician recommends.

I watched her seat a family there and they too remarked on the table slant and  moved as well.  My waiter had absolutely no humor, he never once smiled, and seemed dead behind the eyes. I know it is a tough job for the rate of pay. I ordered flan first, he gave me a look of disapproval, I finished it promptly and he never took the dish off our table, the whole time. I had to ask staff who passed by our table for chips twice, he was nowhere to be found, I asked him for two extra napkins when he delivered our food and he never gave them to us even though I watched him restock napkins at the station, so I got them from a fast moving waitress, she was very kind. He never once came to our table to check on us and he dropped the bill off with not a word or a glance. Had my ""flan first"" order offended him? I tipped 15% under severe duress. The potato tacos were dry as could be and I hurt my tooth but since my drink was not refilled I had to push through. There were plenty of flies to go around and we were swatting all the live long day. I tipped the salsa lady more than the waiter, I am sorry but she has to push that little cart around and make salsa really fast."

Yes, it is the quietest I've come across in the general foothills area as a large complex goes. Beautiful grounds, lush, peaceful, and many old overhanging trees for shade. Downsides: 1. For a two bedroom two bath it was going to be $375 more than what I'm paying now for a same size apartment on 4 miles down the road still int he Foothills area.  2. The dishwasher door would not could not be opened all the way, it hit the cupboard, same thing for the refrigerator door, I asked the girl showing the apartment ""How would I take out the refrigerator bottom crisper drawer to wash it?"" she said ""I don't know."" and that was the end of that. 3. Covered parking is ""first come first serve"" forget that as someone who may not get home from work and school until 10 that is never going to work. 4. A rickety little hot water heater inside the apartment in a tiny little closet looked unfinished. 5. The kitchen was so narrow I'd have to drop 75 pounds just to cook in it and turn around, forget cooking with someone else in there with you. 6. I'm am so tired of places advertising a rate only to get there and you have about six additional fees for existing, such as pet, water, location of apartment in complex, etc. 7. They are not motivated to lease, meaning no specials, no discounts for ANYTHING, no waiving or adjusting if you pay application fee they will not forward it to your deposit or whatever. I'll stay where I am for now and will buy before renting from this organization. At least where I am now they waived the $400 pet deposit if I got renters insurance from their chosen agent and I only paid a $99 deposit to move in. Oh, and also next time they hire a leasing agent, they might consider drug testing them."

Wifi: 'Free' upgrade to the higher speed wifi available. The problem? The higher speed wifi, on top of being very slow, was pretty intermittent.

I'd give it a solid A as well. I wouldnt come here just for the ice cream, but it was a good ending to the meal.  If you're in the area, it's worth stopping by here for food.

The waffles were nice balance of soft and crisp with deep golden brown color.  They are not your Belgian waffle type but I enjoyed the different take.  The Rooster Brew is great beer to accompany it all.   I only sampled some totchos and realized that needs be part of my order from now on.  You can get a half/full order of them.

While this location in Marana is new (formerly chopstix), we were excited to finally have Vietnamese food close to home. While we expected the same consistency as the Miss Saigon off Ina, it turns out that this location is more disappointing rather than exciting. When we ordered food here for the first time, it was the pho soup to-go but they had left out several items such as the hoisin sauce, but worse they completely gave us the wrong order. This happened the SECOND time we ordered to-go. From what I heard, the same chopstix workers were kept which may have been the lack of training. I'm sorry but Chopstix is Chinese Food, which is completely different from Vietnamese food. The food here was extra greasy, not consistent, and horrible customer service. We would much rather drive the extra 10 minutes to the other location off Ina Rd."

I'll just start off by saying we have been to the several Nico's Shop in town with no complaints, but this Cortaro Rd location is by far the worst one. We came home and what was supposed to be a Carne Asada Burrito (with added egg) ended up having barely carne asada with just ALL egg. We had to drive and bring the burrito back, explaining in a friendly way, what our order should have been (thinking they may have misunderstood us). Martha (the lady at the register) was rude and ONLY added sour cream and pico, & left the rest of the order as is. Clearly they had to add all this extra egg for the lack of carne asada to make more money on people. There was also HAIR in the burrito (not sure if she did this on purpose).   Let me also point out that this was NOT the first time we were disappointed by this location & was hoping they would improve.  THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE YOU WILL GET IN TOWN. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. You are better off going to other Nico's locations.

I finally got an email response from the company and got a more straight forward answers that basically nothing is vegan. If you're going to put an item that is otherwise vegan on your menu, you need to educate your staff. People are vegan for a multitude of reason, including intolerances and allergens, so your staffs ignorance could actually make someone sick. This is by no means a jab at the staff, *almost* every server I've had was very kind, but it is more of a response to their lack of training on allergens. Also, the last time I was in here (months ago) I ordered the gardein wings with ""Vegan citrus BBQ sauce on the side"" and a veganised Bloody Mary and the drink came back with a huge slice of bacon in it. Probably best to avoid this restaurant if you have any kind of dietary restrictions as they seem to be poorly educated on the menu."

After living in Okinawa for 3 years and occasional travel to the mainland (japan) I can say their style is on point. Even the seating is very Japanese...meaning if you can't fill a big table you'll get to know your neighbors. As a Japanese ramen house be advised if you take folks that can't work chopsticks ask for a fork! Favorite so far is Spicy miso but the tonkitsu  is also very good.

I can say this with confidence since I lived in Okinawa for 3 years and took my kids to a place almost identical to this at least once a week. Let's start with the extras (tempura, onigiri, etc). Had the yam & shrimp tempura. Yam was still hard & crunchy meaning it wasn't par cooked long enough before hitting the fryer. Shrimp was overdone. The onigiri was bigger than most places offer. But when the place advertises salmon and made to order I expect fresh salmon like they serve in Japan or a sushi restaurant. Not a tuna sandwich made with cooked salmon wrapped in rice. For the price they're selling it they better nail these things.  For the mains the Udon was actually on point...except they add canned corn they didn't wash well. I think most of the reviews saying it's bland are because folks are choosing the veggie broth not the fish broth. Trust me the fish broth is original and the way they served it when I was in Okinawa. You need to load your Kake Udon up with the extras at the extra bar like green onions, fried tempura batter and pickled ginger. That's what makes Udon Udon.   The curry was absolutely awful. Super salty and tasted like a pre-made whipped up in Mr. Mike...as in microwave. Also the rice was WAAAYYY off! It was Uncle Bens. Come on if you're going to establish a Japanese eatery you better use the correct staple product: Nishiki rice.   If you want a quick Kake Udon it's acceptable. But for anything else there's much better options. I'd suggest the owners pair down the menu and make the core dishes on point."

We asked for another and they didn't even bother to put fresh chips on there. Lame! Calamari was standard diner expectations & delivery. Ahi tuna salad was way overdressed and the salad had been sitting there a while...all the produce was wilted and flat...I guess it was time for some inventory turnover. The salmon was ok. They did cook the Israeli couscous well but the asparagus was over cooked. Tacos were lame even for a diner. The personal pizza was what you'd expect...nothing special.  I guess it's an ok place if you have a bunch of friends that want a power hour at a bar with a bunch of drunk food options. If you plan on staying sober I'd steer clear.

A dish of half-n-half arrives with the coffee, you don't have to ask for it. That's nothing, there's 2 kinds of hot sauce (including Verde).on the table, extinguishing the boring need to ask and wait for them as in most other breakfast places.   But what I liked best was the ""build your own breakfast"" of any 4 items for $5-something.  I chose:  (1) coffee, (2) two eggs, (3) hash browns and toast, and (4) sausage patty.  Pairing-up hash browns And toast as one selection, was an act of Jerry Bob genius.  Yes, at $2.09 per cup, the overall price of a meal goes down if you make it one of the four items rather than have it separately. Ladyfriend had tomatoes as one of her items, and got a nice 4 or 5 good-sized slices and was just about thrilled.  I'm not one of those awful folks who go to these places just to chat endlessly with the poor waitresses, and if I was, I'd be disappointed here, for they're just too busy for chit chat, yet maintain a good esprit de corp.

The $2.00 specials, like biscuits 'n gravy with hash browns, are extremely economical. ALL the Specials are under $10.  Of all their breakfast combos, I like the $8 special which includes both coffee and juice, 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, and 2 pancakes. I believe it comes with a choice of toast or hash browns as well.  (You can substitute if you don't want the pancakes!)  The fact it includes coffee saves you $2 on your bill over what you'd pay on the other specials.  You do have to look at your check to ser that they have not charged you an extta $2 on top of the breakfast however!  The waitress told me why they frequently add $2.  It's Because if you come in and first asked for coffee she will put $2 for coffee down on the tab, and forget to remove it once you order the breakfast that comes with coffee.   If there is any problem at all here, it's that it's a larger Denny's than most, and when it fills-up, the kitchen can't keep up with the orders. If waiting to get one's order is infuriating, this can be easily solved by avoiding this location on the weekends and coming in on weekdays."

Listen to his recording with the times that he's open and you'll see that he's open all over the place but not at 8 o'clock usually! On Sabbath days and Holy days he's not open at all, of course!   Now, as to his kosher Vienna beef and Polish dogs. The biggest secret is that when he first gets there and sets up, the hot dogs are raw and cold. He puts them in a metal basin of water, which slowly heats up and then starts heating up the hot dogs. When I got there at 8:45 he told me to come back in a half hour or I would be eating them raw. That's exactly the word he used... raw!  So I came back in 40 minutes. Others had gathered, coming from this far away as Phoenix. ""Let this guy have 'em first!  He's been waiting the longest!""  First I had the Polish sausage and then I had the Vienna beef. He brings along some tables and chairs for the parking lot... it really is quite anomalous and fantastic, his setup!

All I could taste was the hummus and the hot sauce  They didn't burst when you bit them, there was no rush of flavor!  Then I realized it was because the hot dogs were NOT HOT, they were at best ROOM TEMPERATURE. Hey, hot dogs are supposed to ""plump when you cook 'em!"" These ones were skinny. This was at $4 for the Polish and $3 for the Beef. Sodas From a ice chest are just $1.   Maybe I was there on a bad night and I'll have a totally different experience some other time Bruce sure has some great reviews!  Without a doubt he's a great guy and he's got lots of snappy jokes.

Curry is in quotation marks because it was a very provisional, unorthdox, light-weight curry:   If there had been curry in it, it might still have been okay, I was so hungry!  But there was only the disillusioning faint hint of a bare taste of maybe yesterday's curry.  I estimate a Scrooge-like pinch of curry, at best. I didn't know curry powder was that expensive, that they have to be so tight with it.   I am not sure what was on the chef's mind.  He might have thought I would think the potatoes were really chicken, but they looked and tasted just like potatoes.  It wasn't what I imagined, much less what I ordered.  I reviewed their menu in the window when I left,. I saw nothing with potatoes in it.  Its getting close to Christmas, and maybe an act of pure Magic has repreieved some big fat clucking chickens and dished-up spuds in their place.. a Miracdle in the Old Pueblo!  Obviously I should have ordered a noodle dish, since that's what people here have reviewed as excellent. But I didn't see any noodle dishes among their lunch specials.  After I left, I called Brother's Noodles from the Eegees next door and complained bitterly.  For some reason, it felt better to do it on the phone than in person.  The guy listened quietly, without comment, to my brief little rant.    Okay, folks, I know I shouldn't expect much for just $3.99,  but this meal left me confused and ashamed, as if the Restaurant Gods had cursed me to yet another sub-average Speedway experience.  I probably won't be back."
8fGYtPTJFoA8WYmQggG6GQ,Gs4OijDfrHzAbocJ-YYGog,E7dj-y6Mt5ESDH8PYlu5WA,3.0,0,"Friend and I wanted something as spicy and Exotic as Indian and chose this place, so convenient, right on Speedway. I was looking forward to the curry. Well, there WAS that, and in any versions and colors and so I'm sure I'll be back soon. Some other items, though...  Appetizer...chicken with a tiny dish of peanut sauce, and some little wedges of what could have been white bread.  was just harshly  insubstantial. Toddler-sized. No, toddlers eat more than that. Buddy asked for more peanut sauce, and was met by hesitation and a cold stare. They don't like hungry guys!  Got another teaspoonful.  I think the problem was this was one of the cheaper appetizers, like $5.95.  Split a curry chicken and a noodle chicken, both good. Especially tfe ""2 star hot"" curry. Just hot enough!  The noodle chicken was confusing, it could have been the keffir, since I'm not sure what that is.  The basil in it was a delight. I took a single green basil leaf and cut it up into a dozen tiny pieces so I could savor the flavor. How often do you see basil in real life?  (I took a picture!  I will try to attach it!)  Their menu needs just a little work on the translations. Could they find another word other than ""bags""?  Certain dishes come in ""bags."" A bit unnerving to eat ""cellophane"" noodles, too.  Most people would not pay to eat cellophane anything.  The hostess and the waitress that we saw that night were both tall and slender as models... absolutely delightful!  Now, if they were only more generous with that delicious peanut sauce!"

Friend and I come to the door at 7:45 never in our wildest dreams do we think the place is going to close at 8 p.m. on a Friday night. Owner doesn't let us come in, yells at us that they're closed  We're surprised just a lil bit, put out,.  he tells us how he designs restaurants in the daytime and is trying to work two jobs and can't be staying late just so we can eat . when we feel like it.  Mutter mutter... Let's go!   So, we're heading back to the car, the guy comes out the front door and follows us to the car and says ""WHAT did you say?""  Whoa! is  restaurateur looking to have a scrap?  ""No, no just a little misunderstanding... .good night!""  (and let's get out of here!)  This is the ""father"", whom others here have remarked upon as being a little irascible and touchy. Well, chute!  With a welcome like this for his new customers, -- giving them the boot! -- I don't think I want to risk confronting him again!   As for closing at 8 o'clock... Our mistake. close at 5 o'clock if you want.  But when I had a store, if people came in 15 minutes before closing time I'll be thrilled to stay open just a little bit longer and serve those customers and try to give them a good experience. Making a bit of extra money on the evening is a good thing, too.  Good experiences are cumulative. Happy customers come back and say and post, GOOD things about ya!  ... Not possible in this case!"

There was a curry dish on the lunch menu, and I ordered a soft drink as well. I asked if they accept debit cards, the waitress said -- yes!    A few minutes later the waitress returned and apologized. They were out of curry. She suggested the beef stew... I said -- why not?    A thin kind of stew, of little quantity, arrived mixed with some beans and some rice. There were plantains, also:  two thin slices less than three inches long.   At this point I asked her -- can I have my soda?   She was frightfully sorry,  and a moment later I had my ice cold soda, about 10 minutes after ordering it, and after eating half of the entree.   The beef stew, though, was strips of gristle, there was no meaty texture or flavor to it.   When it came my turn to pay, I presented my debit card.  She came back from the counter a moment later and said: ""I'm sorry sir, the minimum debit is $8.00.""  which was a dollar more than my bill. I paid it ...but I wish I had at least said something about my disappointment with the meal and the service.   And when I left I realized that she had not given me a copy of the receipt, either.   I've always enjoyed Caribbean food until this visit to CeeDee's Jamaican. A friend may try to  drag me in for dinner here sometime, but I don't know if I'll give them another chance."

Nothing bad about some ice-cold brew to go with that either!         There was nothing at all wrong with the waitresses that I could see!  I did not see any lack of cleanliness in the well-laid-out eating area, either.  Rumors of arthropods and anthropoids are just attempts to be funny.     There is a lingering sadness in the front room, though, because their Off Track Betting has not gone out of fashion, exactly, it's just that the average guys -- and this place was filled with average horse players -- just don't have the resources anymore to be throwing away money. I know I don't!  Belmont, Aquaduct, Hollywood Park... Come in the daytime,  the races are on, but there's hardly anybody home.     Brand new, much brighter signs have been added outside, just in the last few months, so the place is really lit up at night now!  Maybe they'll get more business."

They're like those beds that conform to your curves. Plan to eat inside and veg-out awhile.      I sense this McDonald's is in kind of a competition with the one at Speedway and Alvernon, down the road, which is rated a little higher. So, to try to make some points, they have DEALS here that some of the other McDonalds don't.  Like for breakfast at this time, at this location, you can get two Sausage & Egg McMuffins for $3.33, but the other location does NOT have that special!            There are a couple of real characters that work behind the counter here. If a Hollywood sitcom of a Fast Food joint was ever wanted, THIS would be the place to film it. One works in the  morning, the other works at night. If they ever worked on the same shift, there might be a food fight. It does not diminish the eating experience at all to share space with people who are so outlandish, they might be from Mars. I find characters like that quite likeable."

But this time I took a family of hungry friends & kids along and we got a few of their Butter Burgers, too!     I found their customer service guy to be an excellent salesman as he started selling me bigger and better versions of the Butter Burger until it was now a basket with sides and a drink. He was witty and making clever hand gestures, he could have been a voice-over actor. I stood there hypnotized and said ""why, Yes!""        The food came and my burger wasn't nearly as juicy as I thought it would be, even though the double had morphed into a triple. Lady said, ""Ed, did you realize you ate a triple?""  It didn't seem substantial enough to be a triple, and may have been a trifle overdone;  the bun was dark enough to be rye or whole wheat, and my side of onion rings was dark brown and sedimentary rock hard. So I took the fries back. They cheerfully brought over replacement fries that were yummy golden brown, not pumpernikle.        The custard was fabulous, I chose vanilla with blueberries and raspberries (I took a photo), but man cannot live by custard alone, though the kids were not complaining at all!       Later I had the most anazing dreams all night!  Let me go up there to the top and see if I can make this 4 stars instead, it was a good experience!"

The brisket is cooked well but the broth is sweeter then I like . I'm having a hard time justifying $15.50 for a bowl of pho I first loved pho because it was economical but this place has changed with all the upgrades they want to increase prices. Maybe we only go on slow days but I never see many others in there maybe they have caught on too. The prices went up twice the last few times I've been there. Since I can get pretty decent pho elsewhere I can no longer justify the prices . Service is good. Food was excellent prices are more than they should be for this area and because there is competition near by. Thanks for the good food and good luck!

A very expensive bouquet of flowers were ordered and meant to be delivered to my daughter the day before Valentine's Day. Unfortunately, the driver never delivered them and decided to take the flowers. Mayfield called me the FOLLOWING day to inform me about the situation and said I could go down to the store to pick out a new bouquet. When I did there was hardly anything left so the options were limited and unappealing. They put together a simple set up, nothing like what I had originally ordered and no wear near the quality of what I had paid for. They did not offer to refund even a small amount of what I had paid. No compensation, nothing.   So in a nutshell, I paid for a beautiful bouquet that was never delivered, they used left over flowers to make a mediocre set up, and did not have the common courtesy to refund my order or offer some type of discount."

One thing we both felt about the food was that it was too salty, so they could ease off on that.  How about a steak house with an average priced bottle of wine was under 30!?!?  It was so nice.  Good brands and variety to please almost anyone.  However, the dessert menu was lacking, so I opted for Insomnia cookies a block away.   I felt the beer selection could use some help, too.  I mean, this town has so many breweries, but Charro decided to stick with just a couple locals if I recall correctly.  My wife's mixed drink was poured well and she didn't complain :-)   It's a great location right down town and really is not to be missed.  Prices all around were very reasonable."

The cookies are really good, and you won't be disappointed getting a desert here (mint choc chip ice cream sandwich made with dark choc mint chip cookies... OMG).    I love cookies, A LOT, and Insomnia Cookies is one of my fav places.  I actually skipped dessert at my dinners this week because this place beckoned me 4 out of 5 nights.     Why not five stars?

Ours didn't seem to know much about the beer except that it was ""good"" or ""people like that one"" (paraphrasing, but you get the gist).  Fire truck seems to be snapping up a few of the places around Tucson which means there is an identity crisis at each location as they still have the old names, websites, social media pages of the old and yet some of the new firetruck stuff abounds. For non-locals, this is very confusing and makes me wonder what is happening.  Either change the name, or don't, but enough with the Firetruck confusion!  OK, the beer.  It was... good.  The few we had at this location weren't memorable (for better or worse).  I certainly would have liked to know more about the beer before ordering, though.  They provide next to nothing about the beer except for it's type.   We ordered the chile quesadilla with chicken.  It TOTALLY hit the spot after a long day on the trails and my hungry state told me it was fantastic, so my taste buds may have been biased.    'Twas a bit chilly to sit outside, but the porch was pretty neat.  Inside was industrial feeling... in a good way.  I liked it the place, which is why I give it three stars.  But they have to figure out how to end their identity crisis and seriously: Get some info about the beers to inquiring minds (remember, the server didn't know much at all about the beer when asked)"

Nice outdoor beer garden with live music and a family friendly atmosphere.  Very good beer.  Food is limited to tacos, for the most part. (Maybe just a Covid thing?  Don't know).  But for those who don't want beer, they serve some pretty good wines (name brand, not their own) and mixed drinks plus soft drinks for the drivers and/or kids.    Borderlands is a short 8-minute walk from the restaurants on Congress and worth the steps.  Really... Just walk 8 minutes at a slow pace.  Go and enjoy!"

Prices are exceptionally reasonable for what you're getting, and the ambience is very neat. In fact, the interior is as unique as their menu (table lamps hung upside down from the ceiling).    One item we had was the Elote pasta.  That's not a typo!  Think Mexican street corn on pasta. It's simply amazing!  Sometimes cream -based pasta sauce are just heavy getting.  This is not one of them : It's light feeling, flavorful, and balanced with the cream and lime flavors with the roasted corn and fresh pasta.  Don't forget their homemade ice cream for dessert either. They have over a dozen flavors.    Five star ratings are reserved for only the best, IMO, and this place deserves it.  Trust me - you will be happy here."

But i don't think my opinion would change, either.  That's actually a compliment to them trying to make things seem as normal as possible.    Location, Location, Location Ok, so this WAS great!  This is the best place in town for location, as far as I'm concerned.  Seemingly everything is within walking distance!  Hotel Congress is the only other place with such fantastic location, but I hear it's super noisy there due to their night club that runs 'til 2am (not the case with Covid, though)    No problems with noise at the AC Marriott, though.  The pool area is nice, but the bar area is closed (hello, Covid).    They have a real, honest-to-goodness Peloton in the fitness center.  In fact, I think they have two when Covid doesn't require so much separation of equipment.  So bring your shorts and shoes if the weather isn't to your liking for hiking.  I wish more hotel had this in their fitness centers.  Rooms are well appointed, very new, and the HVAC is one of the best you could ask for.  Parking is on site and is $20 a day for self park with in-and-out privileges.  This is a super convenient place to park, so we bit the $20/day bullet due to lack of anything better.  The restaurant and bar area are only open for breakfast or dinner on weekends.  We only ate breakfast there once and it did not please.  I'm glad I have enough status where that didn't cost me anything because paying for it would have been seriously disappointing.  There's only three items to choose from and each tasted like it was highly processed, microwaved food.  Our server was the only person working, so everything took a long time.  Coffee was over-brewed, too, so I went back to the room to get another cup instead of asking for a second in the restaurant.  But... It's Covid, so a break will be given at this time.  We'll be back to Tucson and will stay here unless we get a rental place downtown."
-RTGWB3PV75LWBOFFzfTUg,tav2vqLQuQr9-MRdHo5d8w,,1.0,1,This place is such a rip off!!! Will never return. The seafood tower cost $125 (drinks added and tip this was almost a $200 dinner) and was supposed to serve 2-4 people and we got it for two and were still very hungry after. They said the one crab leg that was on it cost $50! We asked to speak to the manager and he was rude. We will never return. We tried the steak side a few months ago and had a bad experience so thought we would give the seafood side a try and it was even worse.

We had bad experience a few months ago on the steak side so thought we would try the seafood side. My husband and I shared an appetizer it was the seafood tower at market price. We asked how much and our server said it was $125 but convinced us we did not need to order anything else because we would be full after it. We got it and was huge disappointment. We felt ripped off and asked to speak to a manager. He came over and said go to the casino you would be charged $170. We did not like how he talked to us and was very rude. For the food we got it should have cost at most $60. The tower was to feed 2-4 and we both left hungry. With drinks and tip it was almost a $200 dinner!! Very disappointed in the food and service. Can get a lot more value for your money anywhere else!

There is a $5 recreational fee (unless you have a park pass). There is also a tram service starting at 9am. A lot of the beginnings of trails are flat/paved for those who aren't as mobile.   Many trails start at this park, and we did the Seven Falls trail very early morning. The trail itself isn't taxing, but it is about 8 miles RT, and you need to take into account the heat. I saw roadrunners, tons of lizards, and even a rattle snake! Lots of pretty flowers an also insects (bring your bug spray!).  Depending on when you hike, the water level will differ. We were able to avoid getting our feet wet because there were rocks that allowed us to cross.   Even if you don't do the longer hikes, it's worth even a shorter visit.

We also tried the Carne Asada Quesadilla- JUICY meat, and tons of it! There is a great salsa bar, and everything was so good that I was dipping it and everything. There is also an area with pepper oil, queso and baked beans with beef (looks like chili).   Definitely a place to return to when I go back to Tucson."

We tried a good number of dishes, including the S'mores French Toast, Plain Jane, Breakfast Poutine and the Beni. True to its name, the place does great pastries, and the French toast and pancakes were awesome. My brother and I were a bit disappointed in the consistency and taste of the pork belly that was in the Beni and the Breakfast Poutine- almost a bit rubbery and a little lacking in the seasoning.

She said we called you but no one answered i said you told us if we waited right here youd just grab us because we said we didnt have our phones.

The hostess couldnt remember even five minutes later that she told us that? She had an attitude and didnt even apologize for forgetting? We couldnt believe it.

I had the teriyaki chicken (amazing!), my girlfriend has bbq pork fried rice (wasnt on the menu but they made it for us) which was also excellent! Everyone loved their dish, all 6 of us! The potstickers and crab puffs as appetizers were delicious, and i recommend you order the asian mist cocktail, the scorpion, or the mai tai! We just can't say enough good things about this place. They also have boba tea! I didn't have a chance to try it but I'm sure it's wonderful! Will definitely try next time. I see reviews about bland flavor and I'm not sure what those people ordered but out of the 6 dishes and 4 appetizers we had there was definitely no lack of flavor. My sister says the wonton soup was also amazing. A must try for anyone in Tucson looking for good Chinese, we will definitely be back! I'd also like to add that I was here when this place was the bbq restaurant  (weer miss it, but this is a wonderful replacement) and they did a great job on the interior and remodeling the bathrooms! Very clean and pleasant atmosphere."

I've been looking for someone who can do a nice blonde highlight (I have dark brown natural hair). I think I've found my salon. I will definitely be back, the staff here wants to make sure you're satisfied and they do everything they can to make sure that you are. I loved that you can even have a nice glass of wine while you're getting your hair done! I had the white, and it was pretty decent! My only complaint is that my stylist recommended a beauty supply store (I told her that I wear extensions occasionally) and I ended up having an awful experience there and getting ripped off. I'll make sure to let her know next time I see her that she should be more careful when recommended that establishment."

The hot sauce that comes with is also delicious. I'm actually surprised to see that they don't have more stars! I've never been to the restaurant, I've always ordered through Postmates for breakfast at work, so I'm not sure how the service is. The food always arrives warm and the potato/egg burrito is my favorite. The breakfast burritos here have much more flavor than the ones I've gotten at any other Mexican fast food establishment in town. I think might be the tortillas that really up their game. Anyway, the shredded beef taco is also a good choice. I recommend giving this place a try!"

I haven't had much luck, but the last time I went to Gadabout on Speedway I was more satisfied with the results than I have been at other salons.  I scheduled with a different stylist today, at the Grant location.  A friend recommended that I schedule with Zell, as she apparently specializes with coloring hair red.  I needed my roots touched up as well as the rest of my hair colored, since the red had faded almost completely by this point.  She did a great job!  I brought in my clip-in extensions (that were the same color as my hair was before everything faded) and asked if she could match the shade, I clipped my extensions in when I got home and discovered that she matched it perfectly!  I'm so pleased with the results!  Before starting on my hair she went over her recommendations with me, which I appreciate, and she suggested a moisturizing treatment as well as a gloss to make sure that the color took properly and wouldn't fade as quickly.  She also recommended a trim (I'm embarrassed to say I haven't had one in about 6-8 months), which I wasn't planning on doing for some reason, but I'm so glad I did!  She revived my hair color and my layers, my hair looks so healthy now!  I'm naturally brunette and am always hesitant with new stylists when it comes to dying my hair to the coppery-red shade that I love.  I'll definitely come back, and I'd fully recommend Zell to anyone that wants to go red, or needs a touch-up or freshening of their red color. The girl that shampooed me was also great, unfortunately I didn't catch her name.  Everyone here is polite and welcoming, and they know what they're doing!  Highly recommend!"

The patio is full of ""kitsch"" with brightly colored lights hanging throughout, fountains, checkered tablecloths, and candlelight.  I've been going here since I was a kid, and its because their service is always friendly, great ambiance on the patio, and killer sauce. The meal starts with their garlic bread, flavorful to the max (no vampires here), but don't fill up! Their Caruso sauce is so addicting, I wish I could bottle it and take it home with me. I also love the eggplant parmesan, yum!!! The house wine comes in a carafe and is very tasty. I highly recommend this place for an evening out!"

The food is really creative and different, not your usual Mexican food, definitely more ""fusion"". I recommend getting the Chef's Plate if you are not too picky, the chef will give you three of the day's selections, and each person at the table gets something different. The menu here changes throughout the day. It is usually one chicken (I've had many different things from Chicken Mole, Green Chile Poblano Chicken, very good), one beef (I've had a carne asada, chimichurri style, and shredded beef), and one vegetarian or fish dish (I loooove the tamale pie). A little bit on the pricey side, about $25-30 per person, plus drinks, but I think it's well worth it. A must try for Tucson!"

We didn't wait more than 5 minutes though. The location is nothing to scream about, a small restaurant in a strip mall....but its the food that counts right? Right! They brought us bread, which was tasty (asked for seconds). We both ordered the Eggplant Parmesan and the House Salad. The portions are gigantic, borderline ridiculous. But quantity doesn't always equal quality....so I wasn't sold. But the first bite made me realize I had found a great restaurant! It was delish! The service was attentive nothing to complain about in that arena, overall great experience, we will definitely be back. The prices on the website have gone up a bit for dinner, the EP was $10 instead of $8, still not pricey though, considering next time we go we will probably just order the two salads ($3.50, and very big for a side salad, nice mixed greens with croutons) and split one entree. Like I said, the decor and location are nothing extraordinary, but I have to say from the crowd and food we tried, this is not a place to miss."

I love getting the Sizzling Parrillada Traditional, a platter that comes with quesadillas, their delish bean dip, and then platter of meat served with tortillas, cabbage, pickled red onions, and grilled green onion. I really like the red chile and the pollo. My only complaint...they can be pretty stingy with the tortillas and salsa, which is pretty odd since they are so cheap to make, if you ask for more they will charge you."

I have to admit I always get the same thing spaghetti with the Caruso's sauce.. I know its lame to get spaghetti at an Italian restaurant since its easy to make at home, But I love it here.. Actually my family pretty much always gets the same thing, dad gets the chicken parm. and adds another breast (Never has had a problem asking for adjustments) He's only complaint is not enough sauce, but they always bring out extra when he asks.. My mother and sister both get the eggplant parm. and have never complained about it..  The only negative things about the place is that the wait can be long and the service can be spotty, but food wise I think it is excellent, However, I heard the pizza isn't worth ordering, so stick with the pastas and entrees and I don't think you could go wrong :)"

The place it meant to be a relaxed/hippie kind of place and the staff I can honestly say the only times we got stressed out is on sundays, Easter and Mothers day, where was are running non-stop for hours. The staff make it a point to be as helpful as possible and very really turned down requests.   Food wise, this place is best for breakfast and lunch. For breakfast the omelets are awesome and come with a huge variety of options, that can also be changed to meet what the taste-buds are craving. The best thing that I have gotten in the breakfast burrito with a side of potatoes, love it. For lunch the best things are the sandwiches, soups and the tostada. The tostada is my favorite, homemade salsa everything is fresh and its huge. The soups and chili are also amazing, the chili (veggie or meat) are home made and wonderful as well as the variety of soups that change every day.  For dessert the chocolate crepes with fresh strawberries are amazing. The fudge sauce that they use is made fresh and is rich.   The only bad things is the place claims to be a great place for vegan. Only one dishes count a true vegan, the tofu and rice. Which is great but the only option. Everything else is made with butter even the the dishes that are marked as veggie-lover friendly. So make sure to ask questions, and the staff will be more then happy to help."

This has to be the best sandwich place.. Its a small shack of a restaurant with a decent patio, maybe five tables inside and is located behind a gas station on probably one of the busiest intersections in Tucson.. but its worth the frustration of traffic or not finding a seat..   Their Deli meat is cut fresh right at the restaurant, the bread is brought in fresh from a bakery, so basically everything is fresh at this place.. What I usually get is the Italian grinder so good, and I have to have one every time I go to Tucson.. Other good things are the make your own Deli Sandwiches they are willing to do any requests.. Like my mom gets the roast beef sandwich with potato salad on it, and they charge it just as an extra topping instead of an extra side order..   Their lunch deal is awesome, sandwich chips, a side and a drink. Their pickles are so good, I always ask for extra.. The sandwich guys are cute and helpful.. The only bad thing is they close early and are usually busy so I would suggest to take-out.."

The carne asada burritos are soo good. The carne is tender is juicy the tortilla is freshly made. And the best part, which some people don't like, is the burrito come bare, just meat inside.. Which means you get to take advantage of the salsa/topping bar. Freshly grilled green onions, cucumbers, lettuce, cabbage, a huge variety of salsa, that you can add as much as you like into your burrito.. The only thing missing is cheese, but you can ask for a side, but honestly it tastes amazing without cheese..   The owner is awesome he remembers us by name every time we go, and you can always see him walking around the restaurant greeting the guest and making sure they got what they wanted.

It located at the base of the mountains in an old ranch style house and they have tried to keep the atmosphere feeling like you're in the old west but the the corny-movie-old-west..   There are really only two bad points.. The wait can be really really long so try and get there early and the mash potatoes are not that great, I don't know how someone can make dry tasting/feeling mash potatoes.. Get the baked potato instead..   Anyway, Prime rib is what they are known for and they have a variety of cuts you can get from petite to massive, and its cooked to order and I've never been disappointed. The horseradish is strong and the side of Au jus is perfect..   If Prime rib is not what you are in the mood for they have other types of steaks such as Filet Mignon, T-bone etc.. They also have ribs, which are awesome and what I use to always get, tasty. They have some other items to choose from..   To start a meal it comes with salad or soup.. we always get the salad which they prepare table side, very good, not to heavy to start out a meal.. Also for Appetizers the best thing is the Sonoran chilis.. it is grilled green chilis topped with shredded beef, and cheese all heated up the topped with green onions.. so good, not very big they serve two  people..   Dessert, usually don't have room for it, but heard they were excellent!"

I use to sell food to this place some years a go and me and my family have been coming here for atleast 30 years as well. Ok Her goes what we experienced. We chose a mid week night to have dinner to avoid the long lines that user to be crazy on the weekends.(I kind of doubt that's s the case any longer) We were a party of 7, we were quickly seated next to the front door, no real big deal but not a great place to sit. We figured maybe we would get great service however that was not the case. Service was just terrible, easy slow and had to beg to get like a salad after 20 minutes it would have been ok if the place was full but if wasn't by any means. The food my wife and I arrived early and decided to get a drink and a shrimp cocktail omg $7.75 got us 4 very very small shrimp like from a 21to 30 count size. But ok let's move on, the rest of the family showed up and we continued. After the crazy wait time our food started to arrive, every dish was over cooked! Some not as much as others, 5 of us decided we were to hungry to wait any more so we just started, the other two in our party just had to send back the overcooked plates back as they were un editable, bad news is that when we were all done eating their good still didn't come! I went and asked for a manner they finally sent one out I told him most of what had happened and asked that he at least go say something to my 73 old mother that still had not gotten her dinner and never did, we had them pack it up as the rest of us were done and just wanted out! They said oh we'll make it right and took off one dinner! OMG never ever again, sorry to see an old friend die!"

The first time was worse than lat nights. The first time they we asked for our apps first and of coarse the salads come first, then 3 minutes later the apps, then 3 minutes later the main course! The main course was like ice. We sent them back and finished our apps. After speaking with management 3 time's we had enough and asked for our check and to forget the 2 lobsterfest dinner we had ordered the one with two tails and we made them bit Maine lobsters and added another one as we love lobster! I let Darden (Parent company) know about this all and they where pretty good about it and I was told the staff and management would be getting a visit to see why this stuff was happening.   Last night my daughter came for a visit from phoenix with her boy type friend. I want to go out and had a litte gift card from Darden they asked me to go back and give them another chance. The service was a little slow (10 minutes before she showed up)  but not to bad. Drinks went well, Apps went well, Salad was just ok (should have gone with soup). Then came the $140 worth of main course food. I had crab (warm at best) My daughter had to send her crab back as it wasn't even warm. Wife had the lobster (no drawn butter). We had all ordered backed potatoes LOADED not one was done correctly. After 3-5 trips back to get things straightened out the last thing was my daughter corn on cob. after asking two more times for it she just gave up.   I come from the food service industry having worked as dishwasher, waiter, cook, chef, food salesman, Sales manager for a major food distributor, and the Director of sales and marketing for a food manufacturer.

My family has been going to Lotus Garden for over 35 years. Upon our return, my wife and I had to visit all our best loved restruants and Lotus was high on our list. We went there last night at about 5pm, we were greated and sat down right away but everything fell apart from there. Although we were one out of the 3-4 tables that had anybody at them, it took over 10 minutes until our waaitress showed up.By this time we where ready to order. We had decided to have a couple of frozen drinks and the ""B"" family style dinner. We quicky recieved our soup which was ok at best. Although it had been another 10-15 minutes since we ordered our drinks still didn't arrive. As we finished our soup the appetizers and drinks finally made it to the table. What a major disapointment, the frozen drinks where NOT frozen, the egg roll was ice cold too, the won ton was just a piece of fried nothing (I didn't even know it was a won ton I thought it was the end of the egg roll that had fallen off), the BBQ was NOT BBQ'd and rock hard (we suspect it was from the night before) . We had already sent the drinks back to be made correctly and after being told that the drinks where made correctly (we had ordered them frozen and the waitress did stand up on this fact and told the manager that she HAD ordered them frozen). At this point we had had enough and told them to stop cooking and forget the drinks. We asked to pay our check and left. I doubt we will ever return again.

There was no one there except employees who were nice enough. When greeted we were asked if we wanted a menu, lol, after she gave them to us we were a bit confused as to how this place works as she just walked away. We sat our self's and decided on the Santa Fe (pretty sure that's what it was called) I chose the Green corn, I LOVE Green corn tamales. I also wanted to order the soup and drinks. The sign next to the register showed the soup of the day. When ordered they told me they were out of soup, grabbed the sign and put it under the counter. So we went with just the 2 orders of two tamales each, (we expected to take one of each home) and the 2 soft drinks NO sides, our total was over $16 some how but not a huge deal. A few minutes later they arrived I quickly saw that they were not ""Hot"" warm at best so I went back and asked them to try again. our tamales were average at best, maybe less than average. bland, my wife had one pretty good one with the filling and that but the other three were almost filling less. For a few dollars more go have some real Mexican food at one of the better places around town. If want to buy frozen tamales this maybe the place for you, I think these are also carried by some of the supermarkets around town. I will not be returning for fresh or frozen."

Better silverware would do wonders as this is another area that was less than five star. I just hate eating with cheap junky forks.   The salad bar was top notch with everything we love and more. Soup was tasty as well. Then for the dinners, HUGE portions way more than either of us could eat. We could have easily split either of our meals and left happy. I had the pasta with meat sauce and Sausage, I found it excellent. My wife tried the Cannelloni which she just loved! The on line menu and the real menu are slightly different as they seemed to have scaled back a little and pricing has changed slightly as well. Over all the service was wonderful.

We still were seated in about 5 minutes so that was great but next time we will make reservations (and there will be a next time) We found the menu a little confusing but we figured it out in a couple of minutes. We had the Black Bean Tostada and just loved it! I could just stop by there for that at lunch and be fully satisfied. For dinner I tried the lasagna and my wife did the ravioli's, they have spinach or cheese one and I asked for them to do half and half and that was not a problem for them at all. Everything came out very hot and made with all fresh ingredient's, you ca taste it. The decaf iced   tea was nice and refreshing which complemented the meal.

If I remember correctly a cup of this coffee (with one free refill) is close to $5. The food is also much more expensive than one would anticipate given portion and taste.

I'm not usually the one to put any business on blast because I know the implications but this has gone on for far too long. My friends and I have frequented Bumsteds and Wonderwall plenty of times for those that don't know this is located next to the Best Western Royal Sun on Speedway and stone. Prior to opening I was given the opportunity to speak on the radio regarding my restaurant and as a kind gesture I made sure to mention them to hopefully evoke alittle more support because opening during the current circumstances is terrible. Needless to say we went immediately when opening , my friends and I had the worst time between the terrible cocktails made by Barb the owner of Bumsteds with no bartending experience to her being completely rude the entire time to us, a table that was spending 350+dollars on alcohol and food. After this I just assumed it was a isolated incident and decided to go back. Time and time again my friends and I are treated like garbage at the hands of Barb the owner. The other night her daughter who is a bartender literally worked the entire night WITHOUT a mask but they have the audacity to act as though they are so strict with covid 19 protocols. Last night was the final straw, I was sitting drinking and hanging out with friends, I was buying, tipping and socializing with the bartender , we were having a great time until I stood up to talk to my friend that was at the SAME table as I , I WAS wearing my mask correctly but was bombarded by Barb she said to me to (pardon my language) "" wtf are you doing sit the fuck down right the fuck now"". I was like woahhhhh okay I'll sit down I have my mask on idk what I just did to warrant her coming at me so hostile. I sat down in utter shock, a few minutes later she came back into the bar approached me, shoved her phone in my face and said "" these are messages to Tony (wonderwall owner) and my husband you are 86'd from the bar after tonight"" she got in my face flipped me off and said ""fuck you"" and stormed out. I have witnesses (customers and employees) that can verify the story. This is unacceptable as an owner and as a human being. Barb is constantly treating people terribly not just me. This place will not survive if this is the standard protocol. I reached out to Anthony Diaz owner of Wonderwall multiple times about this situation with no response back . This is not an isolated incident and many many customers have experienced the same situations with Barb at this bar/restaurant."

With  all the guests, such as in Spain, raising their napkins above their heads and swirling them about, singing ole, ole, ole, ole (ole and ole and ole!!!!) everyone is boisterous and included. It is extremely and earnestly fun.  It's a 2 story building with a dance floor below, or the first floor; you enter on the top, second floor.   One of my wonderful companions for this particular evening uses a wheelchair and wanted to be able to experience the party better.   Casa Vincente is surprisingly wheelchair friendly, with an inside ramp, which is what everyone utilizes to get between the two levels.  In a relatively trendy yet older part of Tucson, its location is nice and convenient to the Temple of Music and Arts and the Tucson Convention Center.    According to all the festive folk around, this place has the best sangria... very fruity, not overly sweet, or untouchably alcoholic ... a refreshing true drink of the desert.    As a Tapas restaurant, we decided everyone share in everything including a fairly large dish of piping hot, slightly spicy, paella, which was served very authentically.  The best however was the Calamari, cooked in its own ink.  Perhaps this sounds slightly intimidating, but exceptionally good.

Called the service department here and spoke with Chris Sapp. He was very friendly right off the bat. After telling him my issue and what LHM said he told me to bring it in and they would get it diagnosed.   Brought my truck in on the scheduled appointment time and they promptly had it diagnosed with needing a new transmission. The only delay came when the manufacturer wanted evidence of there being no modifications to the car that might void warranty as the repair was very expensive. Thankfully, I had none as that would have been a painful lesson to learn. Manufacturer's approval took roughly 3-4 business days.   Once that was done, I came back to the dealership, received a loaner car, and was on my way. Finding the part and the repair took around 4 days. I honestly expected longer so I was thrilled. Throughout this experience, Chris really was great to work with and busted a** working on mine and numerous other vehicles. I think he represents his company very well and hope to use him in the future for any Dodge services I may need.   Thank you Chris Sapp and thank you Jim Click Dodge for taking care of the issue."

Upon the second time of saying it, the bouncer proceeded to turn around and tell me he heard me, there were multiple blue cards, and to pipe down in a very aggressive manner. I said I'd take my future business elsewhere to which he said, ""Good do it. We don't care."" When my friend received her bill I wrote ""Pipe Down"" as the tip amount. About 15 minutes later my other friend I arrived with received his bill to which I also wrote ""Pipe Down"" as the tip amount. Before I could finish the same phrase as the tip, he attempted to grab the pen out of my hand and said, ""Fuck off. This isn't your tab."" My friend then said it was fine and I could close his tab for him. As I finished writing it, the bartender then proceeded to yank my friends beer away, spilling it in on himself in the process. He then threw the pen at me which hit me in the chest as we chuckled at the outrageousness of the situation and walked out. My brothers then walked to the bar to ask what happened to which he said, ""that guy just threw a beer at me and walked out.""

I silently waited as they put my tire on and a manager came up to me and asked if I understood why it couldn't be repaired. I said yes, but he began explaining further anyway. He stated that dirt and water gets in between the plug and the tire and rust forms and because of this they couldn't repair it. Obviously a different story than what I was initially told. He again asked if I wanted to replace it and I politely said no as now more red flags were raised.   Called this tire shop, explained what I was told by Discount, and the gentleman laughed and said to bring it on over and he'd get it fixed.

The arrival of wisdom teeth and unclosed growth plates in my jaw caused my teeth to crowd as well as the return of the natural underbite I once had. After a few years of being on the fence about getting braces I decided to finally take the plunge and get them on again at the prime age of 21. What a great decision that was.   Just starting a career in real estate, I wanted a smile I was confident in. The same could be said really for any profession and just life in general. Let me tell you the office of Dr. JAW gave me just that.   I mostly saw Dr. Weaver for my appointments. The guy has a great sense of humor and made the appointments rather enjoyable. The two other doctors were equally as good as well as with all of their techs. I couldn't recommend this place more.   If you're no longer in the typical age range for braces and are indecisive about taking the plunge I highly recommend you just do it.

Not that crowded actually but the waitress was rude, Lynn was wiping down the table because it had not been cleaned yet and the waitress grabbed the towel out of her hand. Now Lynn didn't want to ""steal"" her towel but we didn't want to sit at a dirty table either and it didn't seem that any of the four ladies working were in a hurry to do it but they told us that we could sit there. Then other people that came in after us were asked for their order and even served while we hadn't even been asked yet. The last touch was the burnt tortilla chips and we could see that none of the other tables had burnt chips....so we got up and left their burnt chips on the table, finally ate @ Macayo's where the service and the food was great as always. We have went a few times to this restaurant and besides the strange dishwater taste of the drinking water, the food was always good.   Life is way too short and this economy too strained to put up with rudeness by anyone, they always say that when treated well one tells 10 friends, when treated badly (such as this) one will tell 20+ or as many as one can tell.

He was also allowed to be physically assaulted by another patient there without any disciplinary action taken not to mention no security and lack of enough supervision cameras, no routine room checks for suicide, Basically no protection or any kind of sympathy or remorse whatsoever for their patients Who are paying thousands of dollars a day to be there and a lot of them already suicidal that do not need the extra agitation and misery now coming from the unprofessional and very unhappy and unwilling staff members Who instead should be comforting and treating their clients kindly and personably and maybe even just a little friendly like one would treat another human being who are for the most part not even criminals but just suffering from their own depression and anxiety, mental illnesses, Etc. if a patient is acting hostile or nasty towards a staff member....then I can understand A lack of kindness and tolerance, however as a healthcare ""PROFESSIONAL"" who already know exactly what they are getting into by going in that particular medical field and are supposed to be there to help these poor people through a crisis or whatever they are dealing with instead of harassing them and treating them like a prisoner is just plain pitiful and disgusting. There are two black males that are very unpleasant and very angry...even more than most of the patients there and an extremely rude black lady (Veronica) at the front desk with a scarf on her head that Yells to everybody "" LEAVE ME ALONE"" Not to mention Jackie who completely turned 2 face on my brother after speaking with a crooked staffed Venezuelan doctor by the name of Rainier Diaz.

As for the retail side of it. I needed to get some foundation and was determined to get it as I had (also) put this off til the last minute. It took me FOREVER to get help. I walked around and around and around. There were salespeople helping others but also some that weren't who would walk right past me and ask someone else if they needed help (which they always did)! It was very frustrating! After at least 30 mins of this, I finally found a lady with a CK nametag on who said she could help me. She found me a foundation and I finally was able to get out of there.  Great place to get product - but make sure you know what you want before you go in or you may wait too long for help! Sephora and Ulta need to find their happy medium. Seems Sephora always has wayyy too many people wanting to help and Ulta has the opposite. (Which makes me want to go to Sephora for makeup instead.)"

So naturally I was craving dim sum and decided to try Gee's Garden out with my hopes adjusted for the desert where Mexican food reigns supreme. I was very pleasantly surprised! So much so that we went there 2 weekends in a row. Yeah the service isn't the best...but even some of the classiest dim sum doesn't have the best customer service and you tend to have to flag people down/be pushy about it. Try the shumai, chinese brocolli, pork bun (the brown one), black bean spare ribs, fried noodles, shrimp on sugar cane stick...for starters...and the coconut pudding to end (I was looking for mango pudding but they didn't have it so we tried the coconut pudding which is very similar, if not the same, as haupia (hawaiian coconut pudding)). Very happy I don't have to wait til I go back to Seattle for my dim sum fix!"

Flavors are standard Tropical Sno flavors which are pretty good (mainland USA company) - what you can get on the mainland easily. Ice is packed and shaved fine. One problem is why aren't they open on Sundays?? I live almost an hour away and we drove all the way up to get shave ice and then saw they are closed. It was so sad. I didn't check for hours online first because I guess I just assumed they'd be open on Sunday. Oh they sell Blue Bell ice cream here too!
_voahZvBqTxQmQNihXuwuw,wqeLjhyY3d6ac2C8dxCBlw,,1.0,8,"My mom was in town visiting and wanted to spend a nice relaxing day with me and was excited to treat me to a pedicure with her. I had heard (from 1 person) that this place was okay (no reviews on Yelp..yet). So since we were coming from the mall when my mom had this idea, I stopped in. The prices are average to high, though a bit nickel and dime-y where you have to pay $5 for extra services that normally come free with a $30 pedicure. The pedicure was average, the massage chairs worked & looked pretty new, and they spent a good amount of time on the foot massage. So everything was peachy ...nothing amazing, nothing horrible yet. The ladies seemed nice, not overly friendly, but there to do this job. We were content and a bit more relaxed when our pedicures were done.   But then....  So we went over to the place by the entrance to dry our nails. My mom was seated next to the nail polish wall & one of the manicurists came over to put back some nail polishes. Unfortunately, she let one slip and it came crashing down onto the ground shattering and splattering nail polish everywhere - including onto my mom. Now this is where their stars went down from 3 to 1. They started wiping up the ground first and then, when I mentioned it, looked at my mom to see if there was paint on her. The manicurist dabbed her with nail polish remover kind of nonchalantly. The first go around there was still nail polish on her arm and splatters on her clothes. When I told them about this (again) they tried dabbing it off her clothes a little and then gave her a cotton ball to continue on her own. There was no ""sorry"" or anything! The only male in the store (I guess the manager since he did the most talking there), after helping with the floor cleanup a bit, went back to helping his customer with her acrylic nails - not even looking at my mom! I was a little ticked, but didn't want to make this MORE stressful for my mom - so I told him that there was paint all over my mom's clothes (basically they were ruined)...instead of a sorry he chuckled and said ""so what do you want me to do? give you a discount or something?"" and chuckled some more. We had already paid, I didn't see anyone getting up to change anything or offer any apologies. So very unprofessional...our stress level was higher than when we came in! I will not return. If you do decide to go - just make sure not to sit by the nail polish wall and don't expect good customer service.  ** Tony, the owner, messaged me here on Yelp and apologized for how things went that day. He says he has taken proper measures to ensure the nail polish incident doesn't happen again and offered me & my mom a future discount. I have declined the discount as my mom was visiting from another state and I am not interested in returning. **"
IZMpFcHP2R24i4nFioYavw,wqeLjhyY3d6ac2C8dxCBlw,9xMDYRurELJTav7-yq8M7g,4.0,16,"I just, today, took my car into Affordable Window Tinting on Grant to get all the windows tinted. I went there mostly due to the reviews I found online, especially on www.city-data.com 's Tucson forum. I copied (with some edits) my review from there here:   What sealed the deal  for my choice was how SUPER nice and informative they were when i called for a quote. I tried calling The Specialists (who seemed to be the other place recommended most online) but couldn't get through and went off the quote estimator they have on their website - which was way higher than Affordable's. If I had gotten someone on the phone at The Specialists who was as nice as the guy on the phone (Daniel) at Affordable, then it may have made me debate a little longer. I'm less than one week new to Tucson so nice, helpful people are really important to me right now. They did the job in about an hour. Driving up to the place was a little sketchy as they have bars on their windows - which just kinda gives me the not-so-safe feel. but it was TOTALLY fine inside. And everyone was really nice and gave you that laid-back family feel, but not too laid back to make me question their professionalism.  Anyway, I'm still less than a week with the new tint job - but so far LOVE the way it looks and, of course, feels (I'm not burning any more! I moved from Western WA where the sun doesn't penetrate the clouds!). I opted for the darkest tint and for the front windshield strip ($20 extra - which I asked for since someone online recommended it, Affordable did not push me into an upsell when I got there). My car is a compact SUV and it was all less than $200 incl. tax and the lifetime warranty. I think that's a really good rate!  I'll edit this if anything should go wrong. But the staff at Affordable is super nice and, as far as I can tell, did a really good job.   ** I only gave 4 stars because they have you choose what tint you want (of 3) from glass they have on their front reception window, but you can't really tell how that's going to look on your car or in the sun since it's indoors and can't be moved. Maybe if they had a sample you can bring out to your car that'd be helpful. I am SUPER satisfied with my choice (the darkest) though! Also, while I am not a fan of upsell surprises after you get a quote over the phone, I'm a little lost as to what would be helpful for me in the AZ sun. Had I not known about the windshield strip, I wouldn't have asked for it. So maybe if they ran through additional options (with NO pressure) then that would have helped me to ensure I got what I needed. I'm thankful that somoene on a forum recommended the windshield strip!"

We go here often because of that. Food is pretty good and not too expensive plus they give a good portion. Check in with Yelp and get a free half order of Sunny Puffs which are like warm donuts with a ton of powdered sugar on them. Very yummy if they are fresh and warm (reminds me somewhat of small malasadas with powdered sugar instead of regular sugar, if you're from Hawaii you know what those are). I got the cinnamon roll once and it was hard and obviously had been sitting out for a while. Sad because it was huge and looked so yummy in the display at the front. The pancakes are pretty big and good. We got raspados once but it took so long because I guess only one person makes them and they have to find her first...and then they were just okay.  Unfortunately the tables tend to be kind of dirty and sticky and service, although usually friendly, can be hit or miss on attentiveness. We were in there once and the owner (Mark) was yelling at his servers - kind of embarrassing to watch. We haven't seen him in there the last few times we've gone though and at one point we could understand why he would yell at them (again, attentiveness)...though never think it's okay to do it in front of customers. They give a military discount - only if you are in uniform."

It was still VERY busy and very crowded. There was a very angry table who felt they weren't being waited on properly and was very vocal about it. Yes, the waitresses/hostess(?) table organizing skills and priority management wasn't the best, I admit. I had to help her out and show her the best way not to lock people in so they can't get out of the restaurant. Anyway after that fiasco was over with we totally enjoyed our meal and savored every dish. We were all pleased - and we are all SUPER picky about our Asian food, especially raw fish."

The booths have this interesting metal table that is perfect height for me or and small kids but I could see someone taller having to bend down in order to get their food. Once you sit down the servers are nice enough to quickly get me some coffee right off the bat. I did noticed that this place is one of those restaurants that allows you to sit wherever you like instead of being walked to your table. They have a large tv screen on the wall and have it facing the news (ex: NBC) which at first I thought it was a radio. Due to the way the restaurant is built you do get an echo effect.  Score: 8/10  Food: I ordered the Veggie omelet, which comes with a tiny portion of fruit, large portions of potato's with what looks like the side is my omelet with your choice of toast. The potatoes vary from soft to medium crunch. There seems to be a different taste to the skin of the potato that reminds me a lot of sausage or bacon. The toast I chose is Sourdough and sadly I wish it came with some jam. The omelet seems to be what I call a reverse omelet with the filling on the outside instead of inside as a nice surprise. Compared to the potatoes it seems like the omelet is under-season, no pepper. If I could recommend how to eat this I would say mix the potatoes with the omelet instead of eating everything separate.  I would also recommend drinking your coffee quickly since they would want to refill it after seeing you drink a few sips. My server was right when saying that the omelet is very filling. I ended up fighting to try and finish my food.  Score: 7.5/10  Restaurant recommendations:  This is a side note on how the restaurant can make improvements. This will not affect the overall score.   * Make the menus laminated to reduce the amount of wear and tear from your menus instead of handing out a piece of paper. You can also leave the menus at each individual table.  * Offer the toast to come with jam or butter * Don't be afraid to add some seasoning to your omelet  * Make the main food the center of the meal and have any sides smaller than the main meal.  * Invest in some sound boards. You can even make them in a shape of a cactus to help reduce the echoing (I can hear the kitchen staff chat and wash each dishes as well as listen in to every customer conversations) * Reduce physical contact with the customers. (Had an employee touch my arm and shoulder multiple times which makes me a bit uncomfortable) * Reduce the amount of oil to the potatoes   Overall score: Atmosphere: 8/10 Food: 7.5/10 Friendliness: 9/10 Total: 24.5/30 (81% or 4 Stars)"

This guy worked on my upper back instead of working close towards where the sciatic nerve would be. I made sure to drink plenty of water afterwards, nearly half a gallon of water.

Each category will have their own rating system that will determine the final score and how many stars does it get. This way the entire review will be 100% honest.  Location: As for nail salons location is always key. The location of this nail salon is best described as a hole in the wall. It's right next to the puppy salon as well as the deli shop. If you are looking for this nail salon I would highly recommend looking it up by the address. Unlike other nail salons that stink of nail polish remover this place is a nice relief from it. Rating: 8/10  Nail process: Now since I've been busy working nonstop. I decided to get both my nails and toes worked on (or a Nani-Petti). Now I loved the cateye that I got my first time. When they asked me what I would like for color eyes I picked a nice tan cat eye that would look great on both my hands and my toes. The lady who worked on my nails started to work on my legs. Apparently when I told over the phone that I wanted a nani-petti there was a bit of a communication gap and she thought I only wanted my toes done. I guess they would have to work a bit on their communication next time. I didn't get any designs on my nails but I guess that this is something I would have to request ahead of time. Now they did informed me that getting my nails done they tend to take a while to take their time and not rush it like other nail salons. Which is true from what I have noticed. Other places I have been to had got me in and out of the nail salon in under 20 minutes. With this one I went in at 11:30am and came back out around 2:15pm which would of been a while if I didn't set the day on my day off. Since I work in a retail I don't expect to last too long at least a week or half of that. Rating: 9/10  Nail Design: (this section will be updated on my next review. On my next review I will be requesting for a neat little design. This section will be left off the rating system until it is filled.)

e4ewOtnmQrTU44QHj2Ko2A,r0pPV4-xj1sD_uGXVYxOaw,,3.0,0,"After watching a movie on my only day off away from my work in a restaurant I decided to give this place a shot. I love making Poké at home so this place seems perfect and it was also new. Double nice. So here is my review. Everything here is divided into categories and has it's own rating system. This way the review can be 100% fair.  Atmosphere This place is very similar to Chipotle and Subway, where you can stand in line behind a large glass and order your food. On the left side of the building there is a large mural of some animals holding up a pug as it is reaching for some poké as a hand brings it down from the heavens. This can give a person a sense of pride that the business has for its food. There are 3 high tables with a bunch of stools around them. If your like me, have Sciatica, then not to fret because they have a normal table facing the window. The ordering line splits depending if you want poké or something else with the register in the middle. If your worried about being cold then don't worry they keep the temperature nice and warm but not too warm.  Rating (out of 5 stars): 5 out of 5  Food The food is opened to the temperature of the store. The cooler is the same type that we use at the restaurant that I work at. These coolers are designed to keep the temperature at a nice 32°F when the cooler top is closed. This means that at my work I constantly have to close my top to keep the food in that nice safe temperature without going into the red. But if the top is removed then all of that food is exposed and can easily get mix temperatures and spoiled a lot quicker. Another big heads up that I noticed was that the food was left on the counter. Now I thought they were going to wipe off the mess in between customers. I ordered a large poké bowl thinking that I would finish it. I didn't and had decided that if I didn't finish my food. I'll take it home.   The food was pretty good and one of the coldest items was the edamame. The ahi was closer to room temp as well as the salmon.  Rating (out of 5 stars): 3 out of 5  Cleanliness After seeing the food and how is was standing out I decided to try and let it pass. Since the line was gone and the staff was cleaning up. My jaw nearly dropped as I saw employees removed their gloves and grab the cleaning rags with their bare hands. I watched these two guys clean their hands with the rags before wiping down the counter that they placed food on. I was shocked and decided to throw my food away. I did walk up to the counter as these old people placed their order. What I assume was the manager (the only person wearing a black shirt) approached me and let me talk to him away from the people ordering food. I had informed him that I saw people handling rags to clean the counter with....out gloves. Now the .... was put there because he interrupted me by saying ""with gloves"" before I got to finish my sentence. I corrected him and told him that I saw them not using the hand washing only sink and instead using the cleaning rags. I told him that I rather told him in private so that it he can talk to the staff. I then left for home.   Rating (out of 5 stars): 1 out of 5  Friendliness  The employees are very nice and are nice enough to explain the difference from a hot bowl and a regular bowl. It was nice to see smiling faces rather than the frowning faces we are use too.  Rating (out of 5 stars): 5 out of 5  THE BIG QUESTION  Would I come back here?  Answer: if the staff get further training for food preparation and  cleanliness then maybe in the future I will give them another random visit.   Total final score: 14 out of 20 (70% which gives the star rating of 3 stars.  Thank you for reading my full review. I hope you have a fantastic day."

The buffet was on the right side of the room while the seating was on the left. There was no smell of that yummy Asian food smell in the area and I quickly figured out why. Now I love the taste of sushi and this place had plenty of sushi and sashimi on the table. So after gathering up my plate I sat to enjoy my meal only to realize that nearly all of the food had no taste. I ordered some soda just to see if my taste buds were working and I could clearly taste the soda as well as the soy sauce. But no taste on the food. Even the crunchy rolls didn't have a crunch texture to them when you took a bite. I have no idea what's going on with the food but I left the restaurant believing that I never ate anything.

We were all paired up with a few dogs to walk around the nearby pond. The dog I got to walk was named Oogie Boogie. She was a sweetheart to walk. The volunteer group also had to decide to help and donate some items to help the place out.   Rated: 5 out of 5  Adoption The options in the different types of dogs is amazing. As we were walking the dogs and had to keep a 15 feet distance for safety, I couldn't help but noticed a lot of different types of dogs. I got to see German shepherds, Dobson, bull dogs, labs and several of others. The dogs are so lovely and sweet. You can tell that they are so excited to be adopted.   If dogs aren't your choice I would highly recommend the kittens. The cats that they have are all so cute but in desperate need of some outside attention. In order to help socialize the cats it turns out that you need to take some classes. These classes is mainly on their terms so hopefully you have a nice open work schedule. I kind of believe that these cats need some mini attention from people other than some staff member singing or just plain talking to the cats.  Rating: 3 out of 5  Store Yes that's right they have a store. And I was excited and shocked to hear about it. A good of the portions of the income is going to help out the animals as well as getting more items. Now reminded that the supplies that they have isn't as much as one of those big time pet stores but your surely find something nice for your pets.  Rating: 4 out of 5  I would highly recommend checking this out and see what pet fits your personality. You might be surprised on what you might come home with.   Final scores Volunteer: 5 out of 5 Adoption: 3 out of 5 Store: 4 out of 5  Total score: 12 out of 15 (this also gives the star count to 4 stars)"

I tend to enjoy the egg drop soup, shrimp low main, or pot stickers. The lady on the phones is pretty nice.

BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN PAYING WITH A CARD.   I ordered a simple combo, vegetarian sandwich with tomato basil soup and a rum cake. I informed the person that I was paying with a card. I read her my card numbers as requested and I was shocked that she read my numbers out loud except for a few. I told her that it is WRONG to read the card numbers out loud like that. She informed me that she only read it except a few for safety. It's still horrible knowing she did that. She then told me that it will take an HOUR AND A HALF to make my order to get it delivered. I can't believe it.   Everything below here will be my updated on after I got my food.  So after my food got delivered it took a total of 30 mins. A lot shorter than the time that the lady informed me. The food is ok. I really like the spicy flavor in the tomato soup. The veggie sandwich doesn't have much flavor in it. When I looked at it it looks like 2 slices of avocado. They did give me a cookie for my troubles and I informed the delivery guy of the people giving poor ratings. He said that it was unexpectable and he would have a serious conversation with the manager.   I have added another star due to the food but the call was so horrible to me and her customers. So that has effected the ratings."

This way you guys get the full experience and can judge yourself. The total score is my final experience where it dictates the amount of stars in the title of the review.   Atmosphere: This restaurant is a hole in the wall in comparison to the restaurants next to it. When my father and I were walked to our table we were shocked to see someone playing the harp. With the sounds of the harp playing in the background it gives this place a bit of a classy kind of atmosphere. The menu isn't in English for the most part except for the ingredient section so be prepared to point to the menu items you would like to order. This restaurant does have a bar further towards the back and the kitchen is right up front which gives this place an unique look.  Score: 9/10  Food: My father and I both got two completely different foods so that we can get the full experience. I got a plate with what seems like every kind of seafood they had in the kitchen. In the photo I had to move the pile of red onions to the side because it seemed to block the sight of everything on my plate. Now with my dish I was asked what level of spiciness would I like. Now I normally like my food spicy so I asked for it to be medium. My food wasn't what I expected. The sauce was more like a vinegar sauce with a hint of heat that hit you later. The clams were extremely salty to the point where my father and I trade plates. My father ordered a dish with steak and pasta. The menu stated that the pasta sauce was an Alfredo sauce but from from the looks and taste it reminded me more of a rustic pesto with a hint of more salt. The stake was nicely done and was a favorite between the both of us. The snack they gave us is a bowl of unpopped popcorn with dried banana slices with an tasty hot sauce. We couldn't help but laugh that they gave us this unpopped popcorn and how amazing it taste. We ended up getting 2 or 3 bowls full. The deserts we got are Dulce de leche shortbread cookie and their helado de lucuma (signature ice cream). The dulce de leche was very powdery and was nearly impossible to eat with a spoon. Would recommend just picking it up with your hands. The ice cream was really good and reminded me a lot of a sherbet ice cream.  Overall the food was a complete hit or miss with each plate. The food could either have too much of a bitterness or too salty.  Score: 3.5  Restaurant recommendations:  This section is mainly for the restaurant so they know what exactly to work on. It won't affect the score.   * Have the cook taste test each plate to make sure it's not too bitter or salty.  * Have a translation of the title of each food so that customers don't have to point to the menu  * Have better description of drinks  Overall score Atmosphere: 9/10 Food: 3.5/10 Friendliness: 9/10 Total: 21.5/30 (71%)  Would I come back again? Sadly no. The price of my total bill came down to $71.49 for two people. With the price being so high and the food being a hit or a miss it didn't justify me coming back.

I decided to order my favorite flavor.   The looks of this place certainly has a nicer feel to the other. Feels more like a gaming center rather than a boba tea shop. The employees seem very nice when ordering and there are a selection of board games to play.   The tea I got was a Thai milk tea with boba. When I got to taste the tea I noticed that the straw was too small for the bobas that I got. And for some reason the tea had this weird tobacco aftertaste to it that made me not want the drink with each sip. Now if you like popping bobas then you won't get that here unless you had three stamps on your rewards card. Definitely something to think about for next time I drive by.

I made sure to get only the basic for myself to help to feed my family of 4. I was so happy to see that they had my favorite oatmeal (quick oats) and I measured out exactly 1 pound. I had brought in my own bags like I do for my normal grocery shopping.   Everything was going well till I made it to the checkout. The staff scanned my items and gave me a hard time about my food choices. He had stated that I needed a print out of the price for my oats. I had to inform him that I had no idea that there was a print out anywhere near the oats area. He then mocked me stating ""sure that's oats. Yeah right"" and then rang up my item. The guy who was bagging my items then decided to throw my tomatoes and bread in the same bag with my heavier items. I asked the guy kindly if he can please keep my vegetables separate from my milk and eggs along with keeping it seperate from the canned items. The bagger then also made fun of my bagging system and proceeded to put the wrong items together. I then had to take my stuff to the help desk and had to organize my food so that nothing would break. A (what seems) nice staff member approached me and asked me if anything was wrong. I explained what had happened and she just said ""ok"" and walked away.   If this is how they treat a first time customer I wouldn't imagine how they treat a loyal customer.   Would I come back?  No, the staff here at the front desk are very rude and dont know how to correctly bag the customers items. If you try to request your eggs being seperate from your bread and canned items then even if you say 'please' and 'thank you' you are better off going somewhere nicer. I will now have to go to natural groceries and get some non cracked eggs and unflattened hamburger buns."

The food is unspectacular and employee attitudes can range from indifference or surliness to hostility.  Since Potosino's is a franchise and neither mom and pop owned and operated nor part of a large network, it can be assumed there is only casual screening and training of new hires.  From what I've seen, if an applicant doesn't drool on himself during the interview, and he isn't on the run from the law, he gets the job.  In light of the reviews here, ownership and management must know about the behavior of their employees but they must not care, just as long as the daily receipt totals are acceptable.  The food?  In a town awash in taco joints, Potosino's is hugely mediocre and unremarkable.  While the tacos and burritos aren't too bad and seem reasonably priced, the combination plates can reach absurd prices.  Why go to the drive-through lane when for the same money you can go to a legitimate restaurant  and get real food?  The two things that bother me the most are their habit of heating food in Styrofoam containers, and the guacamole.  Heating cooked food in Styrofoam containers is cheap, stupid and dangerous.  I hope the Health Department is listening.  The guacamole is, in a word, wretched.  Potosino's guacamole is neither a solid nor a semi-solid; it is a runny liquid.  The half-pint comes in a Styrofoam clam-shell container instead of a cup with a lid, so if you're not careful, you'll end up with a boot-full of heinous green liquid.  Lumps of avocado or salsa?  Not at Potosino's, where they want to stretch a single avocado to last all month."

The food, which I have ordered on a couple of different occasions, is very good-- and the pricing seems reasonable to me. Service has always been really quick with a smile.    I recommend Kneaders as a good spot for lunch.   How Kneaders could improve: the music inside the store is over the top even for someone like myself (who is no spring chicken, shall we say) and who really likes ""oldies"" and ""rock and roll"". The decor is also over the top with the kitsch--Kneaders should certainly deemphasize the center isle stuff. I imagine this ambience works well in Texas or Kentucky, but the north Tucson vibe needs to be a bit more up-to-date in order to have customers feel comfortable. Kneaders, if you revamped your sound and decor to tone it down a bit, (no need for a total make-over, just a few cosmetic procedures) I predict you would get a lot more business.  Most importantly, Kneaders' take-out packaging needs to be rethought to be more ecological. No need for the voluminous amount of plastic (tray and bag) that comes with a simple sandwich. The packaging is efficient, nicely put together and pretty, but a more ecological approach is appreciated by customers in today's world."

He had the rack of lamb, which he told me he thought was really delicious. Our dining companion had the wild Scottish salmon, which she reported as delicious. Food was excellent all around.   Atmosphere: the noise level was extraordinary. I think that ceiling baffles or other permanent noise improvements need to be made. The restaurant has a half-wall that divides the main dining room. Perhaps putting up a glass barrier on the half wall would help to decrease the din. Seriously, to speak to the waiter we had to yell.   The outdoor patio might be the best place to request a table. It is small and would work well on the many nights that the temperature would allow outside dining.  Service: our waiter was very attentive and professional. Well done.  So, overall, four stars instead of five, due to noise level. I hope that the owners can do something about the noise,  because I'd like to have the WGG on the regular list."

It is a totally unique place which incorporates the beauty of the desert. I love the way it is laid out, in a very spacious way, in a spectacular setting. During my most recent visit, I realized how it acquired its name as we watched the magnificent sunset over the Tucson Mountains and the twinkling stars start to appear from our room balcony. The common areas of the hotel are lovely, and were updated maybe about ten years ago. The room I stayed in had been updated recently and the bathroom was very nice with a luxury walk-in shower. I do wish the grounds were in better shape-- they are well-kept and beautiful but many places are in need of refurbishment. I'm just afraid if the place gets refurbished it will lose its unique character and charm. That being said, it would be wonderful to see some items changed-- carpeting on the external stairs needs replacing, the sliding glass doors need to be replaced in the rooms, etc. I could choose to stay in a new, perfectly situated but soul-less spot at hotel down the street-- one that looks the same as every other one in any other town.

What we liked: of course the view from the front window is very good-- if you go be sure to specify you want either the back patio (for outside dining) or near the windows in the front room when you make a reservation. The food remains good, although be prepared for significant price increases.   What was not so good: The main room seems overly large, noisy and packed with diners. I read below where someone compared it to a cruise ship atmosphere and I would agree. The atmosphere in the new location is much LESS intimate and classy than in the previous St. Phillips location. The lighting is much too bright. Some candles on the tables and maybe some rugs might help mitigate the brash atmosphere, which is also so noisy as to be intolerable. From music? No. From large nearby tables of drunk patrons. Noise mitigation should be Job One at Vivace.  Our wait staff continually addressed us as ""dears""-- did this person confuse us with family members? Very condescending.  We miss the old Vivace but time marches on, doesn't it."

Shortly after that we got a call from Pablo that he was on his way. Got here within a half hour, which was after hours around 6:30 pm. He was very professional and knowledgeable. Wore a mask and booties when he entered the house. He got the toilet working within minutes and when I asked him about whether or not we should root out the whole line (which we've had to do in years past) he took the time to assess our situation and discuss the pros and cons.

_kBK459r059UhIR-dTIq9Q,TE8UUL4mmQifl7AGOGNl5w,NGMLSJq_qDgFfZc2-4xwEg,1.0,7,"Terrible company. Comcast is the only company offering cable in our area and so clearly they don't think they need to provide decent service. They've got their customers by the short hairs.  Just wish I'd read the reviews here before trying them.  I decided to try them since my DISH service isn't very good and my CenturyLink service is slow and subject to problems. The phone lines need to be replaced and they've said it's not worth the cost for them to do it, since it would have to be the whole area. I frequently have to unplug my modem and plug it back in again to get it to operate properly.  My brother suggested I try cable, so I contacted Comcast/Xfinity.  At first it seemed great.  Comcast was able to cover my T.V. internet, land line, and security system service for a little less than I was paying for several other companies.  We arranged to have my land line number ported to the new service so I didn't have to change my number, and scheduled a time for them to come out about a week later to hook it all up. On that day, they came out promptly. The service guys were courteous and well informed.  However, they discovered that the cable out to the street was defective and needed to be replaced, and so the process would be delayed until they could do that.  They rescheduled the installation about 2 weeks later.  Someone came out and marked the lines with blue lines and arrows, so it looked like putting in the cable was going forward.   Then a few days later on a Saturday, suddenly my internet and phone lines went out completely. Called Comcast and after waiting for an operator about 25 minutes found out it was because the order to have my number ported over didn't get changed when the installation was delayed.  They said they couldn't fix it any sooner than the scheduled date to come out, which would make me without internet and phone for about a week and a half. I said this was unacceptable for multiple reasons, including a home business. Could they transfer the number back to CenturyLink in the meantime. No, that would take 7-10 days to do. The person I talked to was very unhelpful. So, I called CenturyLink and on a Saturday got a technician who actually knew what he was doing. Even though he understood that I was trying to switch my service, he called Comcast, added me to the line, and again after waiting a loooong time on hold, we got a Comcast service technician. The CenturyLink guy was able to use the right terminology and tell them how to port back my number. So, that day I got phones & internet back and was awaiting the cable installation and then hooking everything up.  About 10 days later Comcast was scheduled to hook up my service. I hadn't noticed any activity related to putting in the cable. No one showed up, no evidence of a trench or anything. The day came and went and nothing. I called the next day. After another long wait got someone again -- and btw, it seems like the service calls go to some call center, who knows where it is -- the woman checked the record and said that the cable had been installed.  I said, no it hasn't. No evidence of it whatsoever. Again, after numerous back and forth and several calls with different people, no one was able to tell me what was going on. Plus, they were saying I'd have to be without internet/phone service for an indeterminate period because of porting the number back. I finally said, you know what, if this is any evidence of your service, I'm not impressed and have no assurance that it will be any better in the future. So, guess what, I'm cancelling the entire package -- everything.  I asked the operator to send me an email saying that it was cancelled because given their level of incompetence, I was afraid I'd get a bill.  She said that the email showing the cancellation would be in my inbox in the next 10 minutes. They never sent it.   And you know, no one has called to follow up, find out why a new customer who was getting the full range of their services cancelled, and try to make it better for me.  If they had, I might have reconsidered.  But nothing. Obviously, they don't care about their customers.  Terrible service and just hours of my life on the phone that I'll never get back.  A real shame too because I think cable would be the answer for the issues I'm having with my other services.  The company that emerged as the hero in all this? CenturyLink.  So, I'm keeping them, even with all the phone line problems."

They are primarily a repair shop, not a dealership but do handle some used Hondas. The experience was completely different from most car buying experiences I've had -- because the staff at Precision were so low-key and positive. The price was a little high because they'd already put a lot of work into the car, but Mike treated us with honesty and respect -- no haggling, none of the usual BS. They gave us a reasonable deal on our used car and got a great used Honda Civic in beautiful shape. They handled all the registration, license, etc. just like the dealership.  We've had the car 4 months and it's not given us a moment's trouble.  I'll be taking it to them for service since we had such a great interaction when buying the car.

Beware.   ---   Grant,  Upon reflection we're going to choose not to do business with you.

You also referred to excessive pressure in the filter, in the pre-purchase inspection report and to me, suggesting that it indicated clogging of the filters, so I paid $446 for replacement filters only to see identical pressure (and decent filters that didn't need replacement).   I'm also unhappy with your markup on parts - telling me a replacement pump was $800, then $650 when I balked, when the pump is commonly sold for $240. Likewise with the popups - you told me $80 each to my face, but I bought 6 for $45 ea yesterday at Patio Pools. $446 for filters that I see for sale for $325. I don't mind a reasonable markup along the lines of 20% over retail for the convenience, but this is egregious.   Not going to do business with you Grant.

I recently purchased a home here in Oro Valley, and during the inspection numerous problems with the roof were identified. The inspector suggested that it was time to replace the 18 year old roof. The seller contacted Hallmark Roofing, (roofing contractor in Tucson, Arizona), who came out and more or less said ""The roof is fine, it just needs some maintenance and repairs"", and provided a low estimate for the service, which was then used to negotiate with me on. I spoke with Dan (the owner) of Hallmark Roofing, and he said he was quite confident the roof would give many more years of service after his repairs, and that he was so confident he'd extend a 2 year no-leak warranty to the entire roof, and not just his repairs. And given that his repairs included the peak of the roof, that actually amounts to about the same thing, but whatever. He was willing to stand behind his inspection report and his estimate of the repairs needed. That's good.     So I got this relatively small amount of money as a negotiation concession for the condition of the roof (did I mention there was evidence of leaking inside the house?), we bought the house, and I called Hallmark in to make the repairs.   They sent a youngish guy out to size-up the project, (I got the feeling he was a subcontractor and not an employee of Hallmark Roofing of Tucson Arizona), and he immediately ran around and reset of few slipped tiles. Good start. Came back a few days later with mortar, silicone sealant and made several more repairs. Said he ran out of mortar and would return the next day (today), which he did. Nice young guy, but he did miss a few areas that were obvious from standing on the ground, and one entire small section of the roof altogether. OK, no biggie, I did catch them before he left, and he did the work, and it seems fine. But not what I would call confidence-inspiring.   Today it's time to pay Hallmark Roofing (Roofing contractor in Tucson, Arizona)  and lo and behold, the warranty statement only references the areas repaired. Not what we discussed. I contacted Hallmark and they then offered to warranty the entire roof for an additional fee. Um, no, that's not what Dan offered. We go back and forth, they stand firm - you want a whole-roof warranty, you pay more. Not cool - it's the old 'bait and switch'.    I definitely won't do business with or recommend a company that can't be trusted to keep their word, and changes their tune, and I don't think you should either.   Life is too short to work with people  you can't trust. You can't trust Hallmark Roofing of Tucson AZ.

When the time came to repair the flange, their tech Jeff got the job, did it beautifully, and when the time came to pick it up he went over what he did, and also showed me an area on the bike that will need attention before long: An output shaft seal that has just started weeping a skosh. Never tried to sell me, it was just a ""keep an eye on it"" conversation, and he showed me where and what. He had looked over the entire bike when it was on their lift, and shared his observations.

My regular chiropractor is no longer practicing due to health issues, and she recommended Dr. Bryan Sloyan at Rebalance Chiropractic to me.  His office is easy to get to, the space is quiet and pleasant.  His manner is very welcoming.  I had made an appointment, and had to change it at the last minute, and he made it so easy.  Then, when I saw him, he ""took the time to get to know my spine.""  I have experienced some significant losses in the last week or so, and he could feel that in my body.  His touch was gentle, and completely effective at the same time.  It was one of the best chiropractic experiences I have ever had.  I felt so completely taken care of, and am so grateful."

We wait for about 40 minutes for food to start hitting our table,  the second or spicy yellow tail roll his the table,  my friend shouts out,  ""ewwwwww!!!!"". There is a big black hair laying across our roll.  (The waitress had just set it down and was still standing there) So they take it back to the chef,  ( we were sitting at a table closest to the sushi bar) and I watch him go to pick it off.  I pointed at him from the table and said,  ""don't you do that,  don't you pick that big black hair off and bring that to me!!!"" He totallywas going to!   So at thepoint ofstarvation,  we ate what we had already received on the table,  then actually still waited for our Vegas roll and blue crab roll.  Instead of this arriving we got a bill,  they had forgotten part of our order.  I got up and made the waitress re-add our bill in front of me. almost a $22.00 difference when she took off the rolls we never received.  What a crock of $%!÷!!

We received your food after about 40 minutes of waiting, there was no bread bowl no extra chicken no extra sauce. So at this point we're still grateful that we have alfredo, but I'm definitely going to call the manager to tell him we didn't get our extra chx, sauce, or the bread bowl.

I explained to him that my daughter has been sick for days and she was finally going to eat something. Dominoes is what she chose.  I wasn't angry about the food, that's always fixable. I was angry about the way that I was treated by Tom on the phone. Scott had the food remade and sent it back to us, with a 2 liter of coke.  Tom, I meant what I said. I would fire you. I would be embarrassed to keep an employee/manager like you on my crew. Work on your people skills. The restaurant business is not for you sweetheart. I would run circles around you.

Well you learn something new every day! We needed a post dinner snack so we tried the new garlic fries - I went without cheese, while the coworker indulged. Then I had a scoop of every flavor of the slushy/sorbet thing that is the essence of Eegees! What a delight! They use real fruit in their blends and it manages to stay frozen even in the heat of AZ. To be fair we were inside eating, but it took me about 40 minutes to finish the regular size cup of Eegees and it was still frozen when I got to the bottom of it. Warning, a regular size cup is a whole lot of Eegees! I probably would have been satisfied with the kids size! I'll definitely be looking out for these fast food locations when I'm on the road again!"

I was sitting for long periods of time in uncomfortable chairs on my recent work trip, which left a horrible pain in my neck, back, and side. I was in the area and happened to stumble upon this shopfront while taking a shortcut (or rather the long way) into the Fedex shopping center. After doing my errands I went back over to the door that had the light up ""foot massage"" sign on. This is the tell tale sign of a reflexology business! Huzzah! It was what I had been looking for!   I parked by the sign and went in, not realizing this is actually the back of the shop. The girls working there pointed me down the hall to the front entrance, where I told the woman what I was in need of. She and I chatted for a few minutes before one of the girls came out and let me know she was ready for me - talk about fast service! I had a private room and a 30 min neck and back massage. I left feeling refreshed and so happy I found them! Highly recommend!"
LuW3EGEP5BoxGGrepOvfuw,cKTA-iJbfrioKWFiDreghw,ZYxGiEyHD17kd80zUzaOQA,2.0,6,"This is Chinese food offered at reasonable prices. The lunch menu offers many different dishes you can order for economy prices. My main criticism is that the shrimp dishes are made with tiny bay shrimp, not the kind of prawn/shrimp I would expect to be used in authentic Chinese dishes. To be fair, I know the cost would be more for larger shrimp but as it is the shrimp looks puny in these lunch dishes and not so appetizing. The sizzling rice soup was very good. I opted out of the egg drop or hot and sour soup option that comes with the lunch plates. My friend had the hot and sour and it was very spicy! I had the brown rice with my shrimp and vegetable dish. My friend had the white rice with her shrimp and snow peas/carrots. The fried wontons were unappetizing so she didn't eat them. I told them not to include them with my plate.  Parking here was easy to find and the food was worth what we paid. If you're looking for the best restaurant in town this is not it. They served our dishes with forks and didn't even offer us chopsticks. We are both Chinese so it was a bit odd that there were no chopsticks in sight. When I asked for some they brought us disposable wooden chopsticks - the kind that they give to people ordering takeout. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's eating Chinese food with crummy chopsticks while at the restaurant. They didn't offer tea with the meal and the plates were simple and plain - no Chinese decor at all. I'd probably go elsewhere for lunch the next time i'm in the area, but if you're craving Chinese food just know you'll get what you pay for here."

You can have them a la carte or as a plate with two sides. I chose the Mexican rice and black beans as my sides and was not disappointed. It's a good thing I don't live anywhere near AZ or I'd probably be here 7 days a week.

I had cut my own toenails the week before coming here so they really only had to cut the cuticles and put the lotions on. They were nice and let me and my friend chat during the visit. After we left my friend scuffed her big toe nail as we were walking to get food at a neighboring restaurant.

The lady who worked on my feet was sweet and when she didn't think she could do the design I wanted for my toes she got an assist from another person working there. Together they made my pedicure dreams come true!   I love that they use a new package of sterilized tools for each customer so you don't have to worry about what person sat in your chair before you and what the condition of their feet was.   They have a nice selection of colors, including several different metallic options as well as sparkles. They have lots of pedicure chairs so you don't feel rushed out of there because they need your chair for another customer.   Great work, Nail Trix! Although $27 is a bit steep for a regular old non-paraffin was pedicure they do a solid job so I would return in the future!"

There have been many times were I've had appointments canceled and had to reschedule them (as many as 3 times before I finally got an appointment that was kept).  Hopefully that is something the office can work on improving.  I also felt they were trying to 'sell' me on other services.

With hygienist Angie's diligent scaling and deep cleaning, along with teaching me properly flossing technique (use your middle fingers so you can get in further) I've made real progress towards clearing those spots up.

Some suggestions would be more selection for the ""big"" menu options including more local beef dinners and to include a vegetable/starch side with the ""big"" dishes.   We had dinner tonight of the rabbit and pork belly sliders with a beer and homemade ginger ale. The ginger ale was the highlight. Based on this meal we won't be back unless the menu is overhauled.

Our tiler was meticulous in laying out the tile so that the glass would line up with and sit right on the grout joints, and so the measurements for the glass had to be precise.  We chose the door hinge that attaches to the wall at the top and sits on the sill at the bottom.  The glass was a perfect match and fit into the tile shower enclosure perfectly, right on the grout lines.  There were no gaps anywhere, and the enclosure is beautiful.  Tom was very pleasant to work with and the installers were knowledgable and courteous."

When I went to the bar to order, the bartender asked me for my order and then walked away from me when I started to give it to her.

He came back about 2 weeks later to show us his design.  There couldn't have been more of a disconnect.  Where we wanted 2 straight block wall fence sections, he designed a curved one.  Where we just wanted some stone and about half a dozen plants, he designed 8 flower and vegetable containers along with a host of other plants.  He had plans for areas well outside of our defined area.  His design didn't take into consideration existing plants that we wanted to save, and the plans looked very poorly conceived.  We have a modest house, but his cost estimate was over $50,000.  I was very encouraged reading all the great reviews this company got on Yelp, but that was not our experience at all.

After I picked up the car, they sent me a text message for me to leave a review with the BBB, but that was a red herring.  They are not even listed with the BBB.  Then they replied to my ""review"" and said they ""reached out to me several times"".  They should check their phone logs.

Now customer service is not just fixing the situation with your customer, it's also in the way you present yourself and the demeanor that you present that service. Customer service should not just be cut and dry. There's got to be a little bend to it in order to make the customer happy.   ""My experience was after buying a rifle I asked the associate if I could get my scope mounted and bore sighted, his reply was sure for $10, And he had to think about the $10 which tells me that there is no set policy on that. Out of pure principle I refused to pay, because that should've been a free service. I don't want to sound cheap, but this service is often offered for free at any gun store or sporting good store When you buy a weapon or a scope.""  So far this one incident is not going to stop me from going to Murphy's again,  The upside is still so big that I will continue to do business there. I like their prices, I like the inventory, I like their knowledge and there layaway policy. This is truly a real gun store."

As soon as I sat down I was greeted with soup, edamame and a hot towel..   I also received soup and a hot towel while I was waiting for my to go order. As for the sushi you are served really big portions. They do serve their own version of the common sushi plates out there. One thing I was disappointed was in the California roll, which is just a piece of crab meat along with your avocado and cucumber. I would have liked to have seen some sort of crab salad instead of one piece of krab meat like most places. I believe this adds a little bit more flavor and texture.  But overall the sushi was edible and filling. This place does have excellent lunch specials. And it would be a great place to go for lunch with some coworkers. But be aware in my experience during lunch the waiters can get sometimes busy and it can take sometime to get a Diet Coke ha ha.  Bottom line if you like to get quick sushi and go there just for food I recommend this place. If you're looking for something more lively I would recommend sushi Garden or RA sushi."

We used to go to Opa every so often, as it's in walking distance from my office, and I had my favorite dish (vegetarian moussaka - it's delicious). The busser is a genuine and gentle guy, and the owner (who we affectionally dubbed Mama Opa) was always pleasant. But I'm not going back, mainly due to a Groupon or Living Social deal and insolent service.  My meal came to $18 - the deal was for $20. I said I'd eat the extra $2, but the manager refused to honor it if the total did not go over $20. After a tiresome and sometimes heated discussion about the implied terms and invented conditions (not in the fine print on the deal), spontaneously created by the manager as she stood before us, it was clear that Opa did not value our continuous patronage.

After a half hour, we had a tight plan, to include color coordinated table settings of different sizes, a dance floor, and a sweetheart table (I was a total n00b, how was I to know we needed a sweetheart table!?!). The pricing was very reasonable and I left the meeting a happy camper.  Well two days before the event I got wind that a freak storm would be blowing through Tucson the day of my wedding (which it did), so I got on the horn with Rodrigo, and ordered huge tents for my semi-outdoor space.

To start off the office looked nice and clean, but when I got to Melissa's chair, it wasn't even covered with a cloth or throwaway paper. Stressed out because this is being done on my eyes, I was worried that she left the room so much. 1st time she left for 10 min W/ no music or checking in on me. I was getting worried because there is perm solution on my eyes. Then she comes in a does something with the drawer &  then leaves again. If something was hurting I would need to yell for her to come in. I had no clue where she was located. This happened a couple more times. I told her my eyes were itching & burning & she said ""be patient."" After all this my lashes were barely lifted. So I waited 2 more days to write this to see how the final product turned out & my lashes are totally like before I went in...No curl.  Bottom line, I felt like Melissa didn't care and the outcome was poor."

I am actually going to school for Hotel Management, so I was watching everything close.  My mother & I had a flood in our house on the east side of Tucson, so we needed a place to stay for a  appx a week  (extended stay)...but it turned into 14 days.  We had a suite (loft) & it was perfect...Mom had her privacy & I had mine, plus our own bathrooms!  The breakfast was great & the social hour gave people a chance to meet & talk about where they are from rather than just stay in their rooms because they didn't know anybody.  One of the reasons we picked Residence Inn Speedway is their ""pet friendly"" policy.  We have a tiny dog, but there was a huge mastiff right around the corner, totally welcoming for any size dog.  Now the Staff...Juanita (GM) Luis (front desk) & Yoli (food services.) These people are top notch customer service people!  Friendly smiles, Great help, & explains everything for you from day one!.

I have a mastiff and I understand that grooming a 170 lb dog is a big deal. I called them to confirm that they would accept her and get pricing. I was told it was $58 and it could go up ""a few dollars"" because of her size. Upon arriving, I was told she was too big and that I couldn't bring her there again. I was a little put off because I had made the call prior but they seemed willing to take care of her this time so that worked out...  When I called to see if she was ready, I was reminded that I could not bring her there again (not sure why this was necessary) and that the price was $85! Say what!! I told him about the prior conversation but he didn't back down until I told him that I would've looked elsewhere if that price was quoted to me originally. He said he'd ask the owner.

I don't know what a ""few dollars"" is to most people but almost $20 more than the original price AFTER HAVING IT REDUCED is not acceptable.

I am a huge fan of Hawaiian food, and have gone to many great places  that Hawaiian transplants have recommended to me.  This  time I have no Hawaiian friends in  Tucson, so I just tried Mama's based off of their overall rating. I got the Katsu plate.  The good : large plate, decent amount of food, though a bit more than I usually pay for the same thing.  The bad : The Katsu was overcooked, dry, and had very little taste to it. Even when dipped in the Katsu sauce, which wasn't very good, it didn't make it much better. The sauce tasted more like a Shrimp cocktail sauce than Katsu.  The rice : not fluffy, just very dense and not so good. I know why am I commenting on the rice? Everything gets scrutinized when you find one bad thing, I am finding.  the Macaroni salad : like was said by others, very uninspiring. No different than Macaroni salad I'd find at Albertsons. I think this is the first time I've had Macaroni salad that was poor. it was somewhat watery, and didn't have the consistency and taste of macaroni salad I normally find at Hawaiian eateries.  Overall impression : I didn't try other items, but after this, I don't think I will, unless I am dying for Katsu and have no choice. Kind of like if I was dying for a burger and my only choice is Burger King, I go there. Sorry Mama's, just didn't cut it for me."

The rice was pretty good sushi rice, well made. Compared to other places I've been they appear to ""supersize"" their nigiri and rolls..which isn't too bad because it's proportionate. bigger roll but also has more fish. bigger nigiri, but has thicker fish. they don't seem to be trying to skimp much on the fish.

I also tasted the Fall vegetable posole, and felt like I could have finished a whole pot of it. For dessert, the olive oil cake is a perfect tasty-but-not-too-sweet finish, but it's the buttermilk panna cota with smoked pineapple, raspberry & mint that will haunt your dreams!

The very nice young woman I bought some 00 wood plugs from (for a super fair price I gotta say, seriously trying to be fair back!) suggested I get my ears stretched up to these pretty flared out plugs (flower design) with the help of their ""certified technician"" or something. I don't remember the term they used.  The technician lady comes out from back and she seems super confident that this is actually a much better stretching technique than sizing up in some warm shower water with some nice soap. At this point in my life I was a much more trusting person to strangers, and thought that they were just trying to help me out and save me time and money, establish client report since I had also been going every other weekend to get jewelry.  Looking back I should have just done what works for me, because as soon as I got taken into the 'stretching theatre' my stomach sank. I seriously should have walked out and said thanks for the pieces -____- This nice lady massaged my lobes (which I never even did to stretch up, but must help right?) for like 3 min then applies some liquid to my bare lobes.  At this point I was thinking I was worried for nothing cause this is so much more prep than soap and hot water.  This dude ripped each ear clean open in like 20 seconds. I was really taken aback by a level of pain I had never associated with stretching. I think someone else also doing it kind of left me dumb and stunned. Anyway she sprays my newly eviscerated lobes some sprays of what must be something good. Cause the minute I looked in to the mirror in my car I saw what had happened. I just drove off that day like two years ago cause I didn't want to blow up you guys' spot in the store but looking back I probs should have made some kind of effort to point out that you guys flat tired my precious plug holes. ;__;  Honestly idk why this happened to me. It was a good lesson to learn though: Don't trust a biz to something you can easily do yourself. I would get my ears re-pierced here despite all that past 'ish cause that does NOT involve stretching however I would feel weird paying the biz and person that scarred my lobes T-T It's a matter self love lol  pictured is what the plugs looked like pretty much."

They are tiers better than Popeye's, albeit a completely different style of seasoning, but still man, you can't tell me the fried chicken isn't lit. Good prices too. I'm eating out here tonight."

The hot one tasted like it was fermented, and the mild was just straight up tomato sauce. Their chips were stale and over fried.  They had ONE option for a kids meal, which they could not alter. My 3 year old had to pick apart a giant taco which had a bland flavorless chicken. I asked for a small quesadilla, which the manager could not pass on. Seriously?! It would have cost less for them to put some cheese on a flour tortilla.   My main meal was just ok, nothing great, the chili con carne was over salted and my tamale was dry.   I was so shocked on how busy it was on a Tuesday night!   I'd rather go to Taco Bell, or a more authentic Mexican restaurant like Guerro Canelo!"

And she paid attention to little details like the underneath portions of the hair for when my hair is up, I had mention I wear my hair up a lot.

Today on the other hand I was ready to be wowed by the food everyone always talks about! I ordered the original brioche French toast and my mom order the skillet duck confit dish. My French toast was alright, a little too thick and not very French toasty, it was a barely fried bread with soggy old berries. The two strips of bacon I ordered at $3.50 was just meh, way too hard and chewy, it felt like I was eating jerky. My mom had 2 small pieces of meat and 4 little wedges of potatoes for $12. You're pretty much just paying for the atmosphere.

Hubby loved playing golf with friends... it is pricey, so they all chipped in and enjoyed a whole afternoon of golf. The lobby is nice, and has wi-fi. My only complaint would be the older woman working in the Women's boutique store. She came off as irritated, unpleasnt and grouchy... so much so I didn't return back to purchase anything. You shouldn't have to pay for wi-fi in the rooms. That was not cool. The ladies in the gift shop are friendly, and happy to help you with anything. Concierge was wonderful. Knowlegable and helpful, they directed us to a few hidden gems in Tuscon. Housekeeping was great also. Friendly. The Buffalo wings in the Starbucks bar area are to die for!

The food is highly overpriced for the lack of creativity, passion and inspiration it's missing. The portion to price ratio is not worth it. I am sure for the area it is considered quite trendy, but hardly by big city standards.The cocktails were okay, not at the level that it should be for the caliber of restaurant it is trying to establish itself as. The decor indoors- beautiful; warm, stately, masculine... Blues quietly  playing in the background. Nice. The place is clean and neat, well cared for. We came late in the evening and sat outside to listen to the last set of the Jazz band playing that evening. They were a local group, but decent. Salad a bit old, dry, miniscule. Steaks hardly flavorful, and a bit overdone... I like well-done. Dry. Chewy. Bland veggies. Soggy. The service was  attentive, and as a woman critiquing, maybe Sullivan's can get these waitresses to cover up some of their boobage? I so get men and the tip factor... but aren't they are trying to make this restaurant an upscale CLASSY Jazz place?  Next time, if there is a next time, I think we will opt to eat dinner inside... no steaks, or have Dessert and Coffee in the  front row of the band...

We enjoyed listening to  modern and classic Ethiopian music  in the background. The server was a friend of the owner, he himself was from South Africa. We ordered our food, and it was served to us in no time, hot and fresh. The service was personal, and intelligent. The owner, Tek, sat down with us and started chatting away! He told us that he is expanding the restaurant. The coffee and tea were excellent. I would have expected more of a spice and heat factor, but this is a great way for people to experience Ethiopian food without being overly turned off by the heat or the intensity and complexity of Ethiopian spices. We loved it. It was filling and satisfying. The 3 of us ate for 24 dollars. We will be back the next time we visit Tuscon!"

Though we had made a reservation in advance,  the owner's wife showed a real lack of enthusiasm and commitment to make sure everyone really enjoyed their very first experience at an Ethiopian restaurant. She came off as aloof and impatient. We were introduced to her teenage daughter, who just seemed to peer up over a book she was reading, giving us a mumbled half-hearted greeting. That sadly put a bad taste in my mouth, because we had such a wonderful and personal experience the first time. There weren't any desserts either. Did we NOT say party of 12 in advance? First timer's?  Well, we won't be in Tuscon anytime soon, otherwise, I would have  been more tempted to go to Zemam's. 2 stars for the service and experience, NOT the food, which is good.

At one point, the Breakfast area became full, so they opened up an additional room for overflow. The after hours menu was very good. The Grill Cheese And Tomato Basil Soup was out of this world... they also make a nice spicy Bloody Mary in the Bar.

After 30 minutes of waiting the server asked if we wanted coffee and then let us know our food ws almost ready. We decided to wait it out and didn't want to pressure anyone but after another 15 minutes we finally got our food and it was truly some of the worst dishes we've had at this place. The brioche in my sausage sandwich was burnt and the sausage was cold. The pancake was forgettable at best so we decided to get boxes and just take it home. The server never apologized for the insane wait and, of course, did not offer us anything for the inconvenience. She seemed annoyed that we were there the whole time. We didn't bring it up because we hate people that make a scene but now we know to NEVER come back to this place. This truly makes me sad because I used to think so highly of 5 Points.

This was upsetting because I expected to get a great dish since I was paying about 20 dollars for a dish that resulted to be so mediocre. Although our waiter, Tyler, was great and very friendly, I was also upset at how they dealt with my boyfriend's burger being  undercooked. He ordered a well-done cheeseburger and when he bit in it was completely pink and rare. When we brought this to the attention of our waiter he was very professional about it and quickly took it back to the kitchen. Minutes later he brought out a box with the ""new"" burger; only for us to find put that all they had done was grill the old patty and put it back in the old bun.

After intensive research I decided to go to Fleet Feet because I didn't want to deal with having to return shoes that did not fit me by purchasing them online and because they were the nearest running shoe store I found online. You would think buying a pair of running shoes will be walk in pick a shoe that fit me and walk out. Well, it is more than that,Kathy, was very professional and knowledgeable. She took measurements of my feet and put me on a treadmill with video cameras to see what my running looked like. Then she determined the correct shoe for me and she was courteous too. All of the shoes I saw were above hundred bucks but I think that for the great service and attention to detail they provide it is worth it especially if it avoids a potential injury for getting the wrong shoes."

You can spend the same amount at a place like mister for an ok job or get a hand wash (that is better for your vehicle) and they really clean it and look at everything.

The first time I went I just got a pedicure and everything went great, was done by a girl. Was really happy! The second time not so much. Let me explain.  I had called asking how long the wait was for a fill, the guy said no wait so I decided to go. As soon as I walk in I'm greeted by a guy on the floor handling a drill and doing some kind of handyman job. I tell him I'm here for a pedicure and fill, check in on the paper and sit down. About a couple minutes later the same guy steps up and says to sit at a station and starts to start on my fingernails. My first thought is ""did this guy wash his hands?"" He was on the floor handling who knows what and is now touching my nails. Gross. Plus all you can see is his gross nails and all the stuff under his nails. I'm immediately put off. Especially with Covid going on I would think they would be extra careful and clean... nope. He brings up a towel that's already dirty? I highly doubt the tools are cleaned as well.  He does an ok job, but super aggressive. Would use the drill on my nails and there was a couple times I seriously thought he was going to make me bleed. Did my pedicure, that was ok too. Went home and saw the polish did something weird. Had to wait to go back to have them redo it. Eh. The place seems ok but not the greatest."

As a family of 9 traveling to Tucson for a vacation, we looked to feast to make Thanksgiving prep easier. We ordered Turkey and pumpkin pies from them while we made all the sides at home. The Turkey was well cooked and presented. It fed our family well for dinner and leftovers (rating: 4 on taste and presentation/ 3 on price). The pumpkin pie is the biggest area for improvement. While it tasted fine, better than grocery store equal to Cracker Barrel, less than traditional homemade, it is way way overpriced for what it is. At over $35 a pie, I was expecting a homemade, well balanced crust and filling/presentation that met the price point. It fell short as the pricing strategy seems to be well over 600% over cost and equal to the same price per slice as one would pay in the restaurant. (Rating: 3 on taste/1 on price). Overall rating: 2.75  Thanks for providing these two items for Thanksgiving this year. It made things easier. If you continue to sell pies, I recommend a price reduction of at least 50% to align with other comparable pies or an improved recipe/presentation that would align with ""one of a kind, drive 25 miles for a piece of pie"" pricing."

I got the roast beef sandwich with whole green chili's and cheddar cheese, expect minus the chili's and cheese. I requested it be remade which was a difficult process due to some poor communication skills on the part of the worker, but 20 minutes later I got the semi fixed sandwich, though this time it was missing the mayo. Apparently the food handler was new. The bread was good, the fillings mediocre. It seemed like a sandwich that  ought to be served hot, but it was cold. Blueberry muffin was perfection. Vanilla cupcake was dry but the icing was fluffy and smooth. Got a chocolate chip scone to save for breakfast.    Wasn't impressed with the messiness of the cafe or lack of comfortable seating. My first chair caught me off guard and I sunk beneath the fabric into a disappearing cushion. I switched to a high top table and the chair was nearly as sketchy as the first. Both needed a ""sit with caution"" warning. Nevertheless I'm alive and typing this review, so the chair didn't kill me. I liked the eclectic feel, but at least keep it tidy. Fabric chairs were stained and worn, garbage can was overflowing, and dish return spot was piled high.   Speaking of cleanliness, loved the gender neutral bathroom signage. Amen!

One sip of cappuccino and my tongue was delighted with a smooth, milky, creamy coffee wetness.  My only regret; I should have purchased the large.    Next time I'd like to stay and enjoy the ambiance while drinking from one of their turquoise mugs.  The decor felt earthy, eclectic, and urban all in one.

The ""renovation"" was negligible.   The pool area looked somewhat renovated and the soccer team enjoyed a morning swim. But the sea green and pink matted carpet, box TVs, unusual burning smell in the stairwells, and old phone booth stations in the lobby, takes us back 1985 and a few star ratings.

We got the Poca Cosa Platter and every item on the plate blew my mind. The decor and ambiance was perfect. It's truly a beautiful restaurant. Our server was nice and knew the menu well. The margaritas are strong and very good  The negatives: Why on earth this place piles lettuce in the middle of the plate is beyond me. It's such a waste. No one wants to eat their meal with a full head of lettuce in the middle of their plate. A person dining with me requested no lettuce. The server said okay and came back with lettuce in the plate. When he returned he said ""we don't make accommodation requests"" and walked away. Super weird if you ask me. The lettuce isn't that great of an item that it's so offensive to request that it not be on the plays.  Personally, I like to enjoy my dining experiences and not feel that I am being ridiculed for making requests to my order. If you enjoy that type of experience then I suppose this place is for you.

Never asked us if we wanted to order anything else.. we actually intended to, but lost our appetite and just got the check. The whole time I was waiting for lemons for my oysters he was just hanging out behind the bar drinking his coffee. SO RIDICULOUS.   Right as we were leaving an older couple sits down next to us and he comes over with index cards reading them the specials...

First of all, Jessica is incredibly knowledgeable about the grooming industry and informed me that the anal gland expressions that groomers do is actually illegal.

I felt very confident that Jessica knew what she was talking about and cared about the overall safety of my fur baby.   I wasn't 100% satisfied with my fur baby's cut but it is definitely my fault for trying to groom her myself beforehand and leaving her face choppy. I will go back and see how her next cut works out now that her hair can grow properly.   My only real negative is the cost. For little daisy it was about $65 plus tip, which is definitely a lot.

Just trust me: you are not going to eat as much sushi as you think you will.   It doesn't help that they do everything in their power to make you want to stop eating sushi. You order 5 pieces (including appetizers, which are cheaper for them to produce and more filling for you) at a time. No sharing. You finish your first five and you can order another five. The catch is that you will be charged for anything you order but don't eat, which means that when we over-ordered we ended up stuffing raw fish into our pockets to avoid being charged over what we were already paying.   The other catch is that the sushi is only mediocre to begin with, and weirdly salty--by round 2 I was convinced they were soaking it in salt water to make us eat less of it. And it worked.   I'll save you the trouble: if you go to Azian planning an endless sushi feast, this is what will actually happen: you will eat some mediocre sushi. You will be pretty much sated, but feel like you have to have another round to make it worth your money. You will struggle through the second round. You will try round three because goddamnit you're paying good money for this and how dare they make assumptions about how much sushi you can eat. You will order the lobster tail roll because it's expensive for them even if you don't like lobster tail. You will nearly throw up as you stuff more and more overly salty raw fish down your gullet. Your waitress will glare at you when you insist on round 4. The night will end with you staggering out into the heat, belly full of fish you don't even like, pockets full of the smoked salmon you ordered just to be petty. You will have regrets.   Haven't tried their lunch buffet yet, though. Sounds pretty good."

We also both had stomach aches after, but maybe that's just because we ate our food too fast so that it would all be over.

He called the office to let them know he didn't want to get that testing done and asked for a refund, at which time he was told he could not be issued a refund unless he returned the plastic sample collection tube he was give... really? So, this is apiece of plastic worth TOPS $0.25 and you're going to keep our $40 if we don't return it??? What a scam! This practice wasted our time and gas returning that stupid thing... Ridiculous. Hope that $0.25 piece of poop collecting plastic was worth hundreds of dollars we spend with your practice a year on our dogs. And I sure as hell don't trust you with my pet again... obviously it's all about the $$$ or you have no clue what you're doing. Likely a lethal combination of both.  Back to my original point, go somewhere else, pay less, get better care for your pet... oh and have a better experience yourself!"

The wait ended up being about 30 minutes or more, making me late back to work. In sheer moment of weakness due to being hangry, I opened my food and started eating my fries as my co-worker drove back to work. When he saw the frivolous amount of the deep fried potato sticks in my box, he feverishly opened his bag - one hand on the steering wheel mind you - to examine his meal. Upon opening his bag he began muttering words of disappointment that only a father who's son chose to go to a different university than his old man's alma mater would say. He expected a whole lot more, as he should.    17 minutes late to work and now I must make the walk of shame to my desk while my peers tossed side eye glances at me making the ever so obvious comments like ""are you late?"" I walked down the opposite end of where my boss sits hoping he wouldn't notice, but he had already been alarmed by said co workers. I'll deal with that headache at a later time. So after getting myself together for a few minutes I decided to take quick break to go eat. Actually, I made that part up. I was hoping to enjoy a delicious meal at my desk until a random supervisor I have not seen in about 8 months popped up. I didn't even know she worked here still! Nonetheless, she briefly scolded me and told me to never try that again. Another walk of shame.  So here I am now in a dark and lonely corner of the break room about to devour my burger and the same co worker that I was late with decides to join me. At this point, I have zero expectations of the burger and have already pegged this one as a loss. ""Do you want a drink?"" he asks. It's the least he could do for suggesting we even go to iHop, iHob, or whatever the hell they call themselves right now. I was already on my way to the mall to get some delicious bourbon chicken and fried rice from Kelly's Cajun Grill (cheap plug, but my goodness they are delicious, seriously you need to go there next time you are at the mall), when he came running from behind shouting my name, asking me to slow down. I reply no, but deep down inside I kind of wanted a Cherry Coke.   Finally it is time to eat.   Spoiler alert if you are planning on eating here, the Classic Bacon Cheeseburger was love at first bite. That love grew more and more with each delightful bite. My taste buds danced in celebration on my tongue as if Earth, Wind and Fire were playing a live set of 'September' and my stomach was beginning to get more and more satisfied. It was very juicy as well and one would have to wonder how they managed to get that level of char, with that amount of juiciness. I'll leave that one for you foodie nerds to figure out. The sole reason they are only getting four stars from me is due to the fact that the jabroni in the front failed to give me a realistic time frame for which this burger would be ready. However, if he did, I would not have waited that long and would've settled for Wendy's next door instead. Kudos to you sir, you saw the look in my eye. The look that said this man is searching for something life altering and decided to call an audible with a 15 minute ETA.   I most certainly will return to this location."

I ordered the orange chicken, chicken lo mein and egg rolls (I was really hungry). I waited about 20 minutes and it was well worth it. The food was neatly arranged in a box, perfect to avoid any spills. And, once home, I stuffed my face! The rolls were crispy and juicy. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and tender. And the lo mein, well, it was epic!   Now, I have way too much food left over, but I'll enjoy the rest tomorrow!"

The place looks modern, clean, and I like the interior design and lighting. Their menu is also detailed and well-designed. Service was quick, and every staff member was friendly.  Food was just OK for me. Maybe I'm used to the higher standards from Southeast Asia/California. I got the Pho Xe Lua Dac Biet (special pho; large, for $10.25). The broth was just so-so, quite bland actually; and it was lunchtime so it couldn't have been too diluted as one might expect at a later time in the evening. The side of vegetables was also of a smaller portion than I'm used to.  Overall, it was a 3/5 star experience for me.

Turns out it's the oldest Mexican restaurant in the country, established in 1922, crazy right?   What's even crazier is that their claim to fame was the chimichanga. Per wikipedia, story goes that the founder of this restaurant accidentally dropped her burrito into the deep fryer and was about to cuss in Spanish but changed to ""chimichanga,"" which is akin to thingamajig in English. Their famous Carne Seca is pretty good, which comes in the form of a deep fried burrito in enchilada style. For the dish, they sun dried their meat on top of the restaurants, lol. I chuckled after reading about that, having grown up in a third world country where we dry everything under the sun.  Their drink menu is pretty good. I got ""the 1922,"" which is not bad. I was also eyeing the charro pink mule, which was reportedly pretty popular too."

My regular room was spacious, with a living room equipped with a fridge and microwave. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.   Their free hot breakfast was really good. It's a very roomy place and the ladies who worked there were so fast and helpful with taking your finished plates. I liked their long wooden tables, particularly cool for larger groups. Of note, they don't have a waffle maker, so if you know a girl who has a thing for waffles, just FYI.  Overall, I'd totally recommend this place!"

I got the caramel brûlée latte ($5 grande) hot, which was really good. Overall, I'd recommend this place for book and/or Starbucks lovers.  P.S.

I'm now convinced that the package was just never delivered. I guess this is common. This experience is in just about every yelp review of this company. Packages are mislabeled ""delivered"" but never show up. Talk about quality service...   I am also sure they are total liars too, as I was sent a message that the driver was going to come to my house and do a ""thorough"" search for my package yesterday before 5pm -and that never happened.

A big applause for Deborah (owner) and Dominique (Chef) for creating a restaurant with a cozy  atmosphere, formulating a wonderful cocktail & dinner menu, and hitting a home run with execution.   My friend and I shared two appetizers and we each ordered an amazing concoction called Poquito Picante made with gin, cilantro, cucumber, and  jalapeño. Yes it has  jalapeño, and yes, you can taste the spicy flavor, but be brave -  it is worth it !!!! Especially if you pair it with the Favoritas appetizer. Dates stuffed with chorizo and wrapped with smoky bacon. The dates were cooked to perfection - amazing balance between sweet and spicy flavors. If you chase it with a sip of Poquito Picante, you've arrived at nirvana.   My friend and I also shared the empanadhinas (turnovers) filled with sweet potatoes and eggplant. One word ""Delish.""  I look forward to continuing to observe Contigo's success as I believe the Tucson foodie community will show its good taste by making it a favorite dinning spot."

I will go back in a heartbeat - in about three to five months when they've worked out the serious KINKS in their service. My first experience? It was a social one. Six of my dearest and my hubby made a b-line to The HUB; Downtown Tucson's newest and perhaps trendiest spots. We made reservations for eight at 7 pm on a Tuesday night; and we didn't get seated until...half an hour later.   Ah...that was the first KINK in their service, and then, The KINK was the gift that kept on giving. Seriously - it was like the bad serviced bunny was handing out BAD SERVIC Golden Eggs. Not all the drinks were brought to the table, server didn't know which cocktail was which, food was missing, food was cold, etc. And then...we had to beg - strike that - we had to implore for more drinks to be brought to the table. ""Please server, bring me one more cocktail - I'll Pay.""  So what about the food? The food was yummy - unless it was cold or unless they forgot to bring the food. Someone in that kitchen really cared about the ingredients, and the way food was prepared. And, what about the music? Oh la la. The Music was sublime. The HUB was hosting DJ extraordinaire,  Cliff. He played a mix of Bossa Nova and House Music.   So, again, would I go back to The HUB? YES. When they work out the KINKS. When they get their house in order and hire/train/nurture qualified and caring servers ""a la Doug from Feast.""  If The HUB can keep the trendiness, the food quality, the music, and kick it up 4 notches on service, I will totally go back. I will go back and take my peeps  and tell everyone and their mother that the Hub is the bomb."

Also, by the time I received my coffee it was already luke warm and the flavor was alright.  Nothing to boast about.  I was disappointed.  I will say that the barista recommended the coffee drink to me, and did say that if I did not like it she would gladly make me something else at no extra charge.  I liked the coffee, but I just didn't love it, not enough for me to tell her to dump it make me something new.  It could have been just an odd day, but I was also hustled by random people off the street asking me to buy roses.  Mind you, I was sitting inside Café Passé.  They bothered many other patrons.

It is full of customers and there is about 3 groups in front of me: two groups of four, and one couple.  I have been standing in line now for almost 35 minutes. So this place is SLOW.  The lady that rings you up is also making the espresso and getting drinks; not the smartest idea at all, which explains the ridiculously long wait so far.    Looking at the menu, it is very minimum for the other crepe places I have eaten at. They also don't offer a side with your crepe. I wanted some fresh fruit and it was an upcharge of $2.00, but the portion was very generous.  If you choose no side, they throw an orange slice on the side for garnsih. The crepe portions are large though if you choose to get one big one.   More than an hour later from when I walked throuhh the front doors, I am still waiting for my crepe. This place needs more kitchen staff. Not really sure why it is taking so long for a crepe when they cook exceptionally fast. And the restaurant has plenty of open tables. So this place is just really slow.    This place would probably be great if there was no one here and you are the only customer. They really need to beef up the kitchen because the wait times here are insane.  I gave two stars because my crepe was good and the prices weren't bad.

I drove into the parking lot and the shuttle followed me to my car. The driver got out and helped me with my luggage from my trunk, which I greatly appreciated.  He dropped me off at my airline station, and also assisted me with my luggage.    On my return flight from Tucson, I was not sure where to go to find the shuttle, but it is really easy: it is right outside baggage claim.  You'll probably see the shuttles lined up and ready to drive people.  You just hop in; I waited a few minutes for a couple more people, but no more than five minutes and we were on the way.  A different driver this time helped me with my luggage at the airport, but did not help me at the garage as did the driver on my arrival.  I tipped both drivers, and everyone else in the bus also tipped.  Tipping, of course, is optional.  The service and the price for parking is quite cheap; it seems too good to be true.  Everyone that works here is nice.  I have since used this parking service each time I take a flight out of Tucson.  TIP: Make sure you store the parking ticket/business card  in a safe spot! I am not talking about the ticket when you enter the parking lot (that one you can leave in your car), but the one the driver gives you.

My room so far looks clean after careful inspection. My bed feels very soft. And my shower had great pressure and was scolding hot. However......  CONS: My hallway smells something fierce. It smells like a combination of B.O. and Chinese food. My room door won't lock from the inside, thank God I have the safety on and you have to have a key to access it from the outside. I can't find a remote guide so I have to surf all the channels to figure out what options I have. They have no electrical output for your cell phone by the bed. The only one is across the room. How am I supposed to use my phone as an alarm clock?? Good question. The bathroom is so small, I can barely move around in it and I am 5'2"". The bathroom door opens into the bathroom and takes up the entire space. The curtains in my room are old and dirty/dusty (like what you would expect to find in an antique shop). They don't have a business center, only two computers that when in use, your back faces the lobby, so everyone inside the hotel can see what you are doing, leaving you with no privacy at all. No staples, paper clips, pen or paper at the business center. I printed my travel itinerary and there was no way for me to staple it, or make sure that I could keep the multiple pages I had for my extensive flight together.  I will never stay here ever again and I'm glad I'm only staying here for one night. For those of you who are reading this, you may wonder why I gave it 2 stars instead of something lower, but the reason is for cleanliness.  Even though there are alot of cons, my room is pretty good and that's all I care about for one night. Oh, and the lady that checked me in was friendly. So, that was a bonus.

This was Monday, June 1st. Within 10 minutes I had received a call from Andrea, a customer care specialist. We set up an appointment for a few hours later and I went to the dealership, knowing exactly what I wanted, a 2015 RAV4 XLE in the Hot Lava color. They didn't have that color available but said they could try and find one for me. Meanwhile, I test drove the XLE in another color and loved it. I got all of the paperwork/financing, etc., completed that day (they had to hold onto it as they obviously didn't have the VIN number of the new vehicle yet). They asked me what my ""runner-up color"" would be just in case they couldn't find a RAV4 in the Hot Lava color. I begrudgingly said the ""brown one"" (Pyrite Mica) which is actually a very pretty color; however, I had my heart set on the Hot Lava. I have had white and silver cars forever and the last thing I wanted was a white or silver or other ""neutral"" color!! I got a phone call from the new car sales manager the following morning saying that they found my vehicle but that it would take about two or three days to get here. I was so happy and told him I would gladly wait a week if it meant I would get the color I wanted! It evidently was en route to Phoenix and would then be hauled to Tucson. I got the call Thursday, June 4th, that my vehicle was ready to pick up. So happy with how I was treated! Very professional and I was kept in constant communication with everyone, from the sales associate (Inka) right on down to the financing associate. Never once did I feel pressured into buying something that I didn't want. All of the ""extra"" options were explained to me, from the GAP insurance right on down to life insurance, and I left the dealership feeling good, like I had make a well-informed, smart decision. I have had my RAV4 for nearly three weeks now and couldn't be happier! I bought my 2004 Toyota Camry from Desert Toyota back in 2004. I have had regular maintenance performed on it at Desert Toyota and have always been impressed with the level of service I've received.

The food was so, so good and both of my parents remarked over and over again how it was the best breakfast they had ever had in a restaurant (on a side note, I've been to Yuma many times and it is a bit challenging to find a really good downhome breakfast)!

To top it off, the last few times we have been to Macayo's, the prickly pear margarita was NOT prickly pear. Just white froth with hardly any pink to it at all. We went one more time JUST to be sure and nope, it was the same. Sad to say, I just don't think we will be back. I will have to settle for keeping my Bob and Cha Cha mugs on display until the day when I find the time to learn how to make my own frozen prickly pear margaritas!"

But just comparing the pizzas to the ones we have here in Phoenix and around the States, can't give it 4 stars.  It was an average pizza kind of night.  So they're basically Neopolitan pies with small twists.  We always get the margherita to compare with every other one out there, and we got the arugula and prosciutto.  We don't doubt they source the best ingredients here, but these pizzas fell well short of the best.  We like blistered crusts, but most of our were over-burnt.  The parts that were not had decent chew but not as tasty as say, Bianco or Mozza. Altogether, the pizzas, like I said, were fine.  Neither of us, though, were jumping out of our seats in excitement.    So I would still recommend going.

The flavors of Impress Hot Pot are equivalent to the best hot pot restaurants found in China, but with the benefit of the high standards of preparation quality we take for granted in the US.  Follow these steps if this is your first time eating hot pot:  1) Order the half and half, but for the spicy side choose MILD (Medium is surprisingly spicy and while very flavorful, you may not be able to eat as much as you want). 2) For 3 people: you would select 2 meats, 2-3 vegetables (winter melon is excellent),  tofu and noodles.   You might add an order of fried rice. 3) Prepare your own sauce at the sauce table.  Start with a tiny bit (tablespoon) of each to avoid wasting an entire bowl of a sauce if you don't like it.  You'll have many chances to get up to add more sauce while cooking. 4) Eat the dishes you ordered almost like a fondue.  For example, put the raw meat in (all at once, or little by little), and 15-30 seconds later take some cooked meat out, dip it in the sauce and eat.  5) Don't add the noodles until the end, and don't eat the soup until the end.  The soup is not delicious until all of the ingredients have been cooked and eaten.  Total price for 3 would be around $30.  If you enjoy it, you'll have discovered a traditional meal eaten with friends that you can find in any city in China.  It's healthy enough to eat every day of the week."

The place is very small, there is not a alot of shelf space. They allow customers to mix and match for a 6 or 12 pack which is fine, until you want to buy a 6 pack that has two beers missing. They should only allow mix and match with well stocked products, otherwise just let someone choose from the singles fridge. In terms of selection, I was not impressed. This may be a good beer spot for Tucson but it is seriously lacking in some major departments. US microbrews are fine, but Plaza lacks good European selection. They have some major Euro brands from Germany, and Belgium; but outside from that they really fail to stock much. Almost zero Central or Southern European beers.

In regards to the spot bar itself, it is a good space and the patio is nice enough. I don't know if this is typical or a one time thing, but the dj was not good at all. The dj mainly was playing hits from ten years ago or earlier, and many of the songs were very random and did not fit together.  Again I was only there one night, but I felt that the crowd was an odd mixture. There were some middle-aged people, some hood-rats, a few students, and a few artsy types.

Nonetheless, there was a decent crowd of people and surprisingly mostly girls. The bar tenders were nice, and made me a good combo shot that was new to me. I used to go here back in the day. Occasionally The Hut gets some really good bands who are playing for less than you would be able to see them elsewhere. The Hut gets some good bands that would not be well supported enough to headline at Rialto or larger venues, yet they have larger followings elsewhere. It isn't always that the Hut gets good bands, but check out their schedule and you might be surprised to see one of your favorite California bands has a date. In terms of crowd, I won't really comment because I have only been here once (the other night) in the past 3 years. Back when I used to come here, it was mostly U of A students and some other folks. Usually when a band is playing there is a cover, and you might want to avoid going in if you don't know the band playing and it looks empty. In terms of the bouncers, I would suggest anyone with a fake ID not to attempt coming here. I look like I am in my mid twenties, and my license was examined thoroughly put under a black light, and the bouncer bended it. Note: I hate when a bouncer bends my ID, it doesn't prove it is real or fake and my state doesn't design the plastic license to bend in some unnatural special way.

While the tacos were in fact excellent, they in no way compensated for the poor service and apparent ordering process that isn't stated in writing or by anyone working there.  I sat at a table and noticed a lot of workers rushing around but no one  said anything to me until I flagged the bartender down from across the room.  She brought me a menu and asked me to come up to the bar when I was ready to order.  So I did and I waited for another long time while the bartender waited in a full bar of customers.  She was then getting off shift so told me that another bartender would be with me soon.  Same story. A lot of bar customers so I waited. Once I ordered a beer and dinner she gave me  my bill. I did ask if I could leave it open since I was at a table and likely to have another beer.  She said she could if she  held my credit card. Ok, although I felt that I was at a night club then as opposed to a restaurant   Unfortunately when I wanted a second beer I had to go back to the bar and wait again for  that 1 bartender to wait on me.  She had a full bar and 12 tables, all requiring to go through her to place an order. Ridiculous.  I want back to pay my bill, she ran it on someone else's card (yes, the precise reason you never want to leave your credit card at a bar!).  After getting that straightened out, I did successfully pay, but the entire experience was beyond painful. Oh, and the flies are terrible.  The chef continued to come out to talk to people she knew and I overheard her even say that they have they worst fly problem in the city. Yes, this is the new location.  I like noticed reviews after I ate saying how awesome the salsa was.  One of the workers left salsa in my table but with no explanation of what each were.  Again, terrible service.

The server walked up, never apologizing for ignoring us, and took our order. The service was great and the dood was awesome. Sadly, the Manager never checked back in with us to make sure we were satisfied."

Cons: no toilet paper in the bathroom. My food took 15 minutes longer than my wife's which got cold sitting on the counter. She asked them to warm it up which they did. It was just a little too long to wait for a restaurant that only had about 10 people in it at the time. We will go back and try it again sometime though because we really did like the food.

It's one of those hole in the wall types of things, but I have to say in my 7 years living in Tucson I haven't found anything that quite compares.   If you're like me and grew up on the border, with a certain type of style for raspados it's not a bad place to come and reconcile different ways to prepare the treats. I like the mango type shaved ice they use in their mangoyadas* (forgive the spelling or my calling it a different name) which is super different than just getting a shaved ice raspado that only has flavoring syrup - they also have this, which they mix with ice cream. Definitely give it a try if you're looking for treat on a hot summer day."

I don't know the name of the woman who massaged me today, and I'm unsure if it was the same woman as last time because she pretty much didn't say a word to me. I can own that it's partly my fault for not speaking up while I was there, but I'm a shy person- she did not ask me a single question while I was there, and didn't make me feel comfortable doing so.   I opted for the 60 minute combination massage which is 45 minutes deep tissue and then 15 minutes of reflexology, or at least it was last time. I believe that because she had another customer right before me, maybe she was tired but I'm wholly unsatisfied with my deep tissue massage. First of all, I'm a bit disappointed in the sanitary procedures they may have for the face area on the massage table. No cover was on, and when i asked about it she pulled out a couple of paper towels which really don't quite do the trick. Again, she didn't ask anything and didn't spend any time at all on my neck, and then barely spent time on my back. That being said, the time spent massaging my back was mainly her applying pressure with her elbow I think and leaning her body weight on me. She asked me to turn over and did massage my head which was nice, however again, it feels as if I didn't get what I was asking for in getting a ""deep tissue body massage"" because I can't imagine that was more than 20 minutes. After that, her foot massage / reflexology was nice and definitely felt like the bulk of my time there.   I'm giving two stars because of my last visit being pleasant; I think I may have gotten the owner that time."

I came in today to purchase a bottle of foundation that I've been using for a while, though it may be time to do a color match again since I've tanned a bit this summer. I mention this because the last time I was in this store, I asked for help with a color match and got an eye roll; after about 15 minutes waiting with no one actually coming to help me I left that time. I mention this because I am not the prettiest woman for sure, and I don't wear a whole lot of makeup so I have felt intimidated and sometimes unwelcome by the staff.   Today was different in that a very nice (and intimidatingly pretty) woman came up to me as she saw me searching the shelf and asked if I needed help. I mentioned my issue of not being able to find my foundation shade on my previous two visits, and she was beyond helpful- she looked, and when she also didn't find it, she offered to have it ordered and shipped to my house, and went further to offer to grab me a sample of the foundation so I would have some in the time it took to arrive.  As someone who also works in a customer service job, that's what I call going above and beyond for a customer."

I am incredibly disappointed in their customer service and the overall time it took to do a simple oil change.   I went in early one morning to get the oil changed on my car after leaving work for a break. Right away, the manger (I think his name was something like Gary) who attended me was snarky and condescending, and I feel that this was because I am a young woman. He said it would be a wait since there were a couple of cars in front of me, so I said fine - I'll go home for a bit since I live just up the street. He took my information down and said they'd call me to come pick it up within about an hour or two. This was around 7:40, by 10:30 I was wondering what was up and gave them a call. The person who answered said ""Oh yeah we just took it in, it should be about 30-40 minutes, we'll call you back when it's ready.""  Annoying to hear, but fine - stuff can take longer than we expect. Well 11:30 came and went, and no call back from this business. I got an Uber back around 12:30 because I was so fed up waiting, and when I walked in it was the same rudeness and attitude except I wasn't having it, and I told the manager there I was disappointed and dissatisfied with the fact that it had taken them 4 1/2 hours + to do the oil change, all the while waiting for a call.  Conveniently, these men were trying to tell me that they'd just finished the oil change and had been calling me for a while to ask if I wanted my cabin filters replaced because they were looking pretty bad. No! I wanted to get my car back and get out of there. They condescendingly tried to ""explain"" about the filters, kept trying to pressure me, and were almost to the point of admonishing me for telling them no.  $80 and a big headache for what should've been a simple, synthetic oil change will never happen again. Be warned, ladies especially, and take your vehicles elsewhere.  Edit on 4/30: still waiting to hear from this manager. Don't be fooled by their words."

The owners must not care if their employees clean or not because the place sure could use molly maid.

It was substantial and had a lot going on. To balance out the health food I had a local IPA on tap, which was also quite good."

But despite the portions, the taste nor the surroundings just wasn't cutting it. I ordered a mexican omelette, which was way too cheesy and didn't have quite enough chorizo...hence the lack of flavor. However, this is a short order place so I shouldn't have had too high of expectations. Yet I've had better tasting omelettes in similar spots. The decor was a bit dingy, but you could tell that it was a cool spot when it was first decorated. Its got a charming diner feel, but really needs some sprucing up. The service was extremely good, but not enough to add another star. Overall, I might go back to try another menu item, but would most likely pass to explore another breakfast spot."

I should have asked what it was, but I was too lazy and tired. Which brings me to my biggest ""like"" of this place...the service.

I like to give businesses the benefit of the doubt, but could not justify it for this place. Please beware...this is the ""Un Quality Inn"". My door was literally split and locking mechanism loose as a result. It looked as if someone kicked the door in. Upon complaining to maintenance that the door was split he said ""all the doors are probably split"". Um ok, well that's comforting. To their credit they eventually came by to fix it. But my business associate also could not get into his room. They could not get his key to work...after dozens of attempts...and this was on the second day of his stay. He could not get back into his room unless the they used the maid's key. Wha!? Moreover, the courtyard to this place was really beat down, ie broken glass, unpainted railings and trim. Just a very run down establishment."

They need to be more prepared in having condiments. The most important for me is guacamole, and they didn't have any. This is not the first time they don't have any. They were also a little rude when it came for me and my friend asking for limes and utensils since they don't have them out for you to grab. It bothered them that we would just ask for anything.  One thing that greatly disturbed me was that a woman kicked out a homeless guy from inside the restaurant right when he received his food. A nice gentleman went inside to order food for him and left. The homeless man was not causing any trouble and was just patiently waiting for his food. There was no reason to kick him out to the heat while eating.
